They accused me of being suspicious cause I came in later in the day I didn’t have a utility bill on me with my name on it.One of the best Frost locations in Austin.

The other location from William Cannon should come here to be trained.
Lida (branch manager of Bee Caves and William Cannon) is not a good manager nor should she be training staff as such.Stopped by with no appointment at end of day and the man at the info desk was very friendly and informative.

2,Frost Bank,"401 Congress Ave., Austin, TX 78701",Austin,"Don't bother trying to open an account with these guys, they'll make you jump through so many hoops it's not worth it. I have 4 large accounts with JP Morgan (Merchant, business, investment and personal) and wanted to move them over to Frost. I called their number, the lady said I have to go to a branch to speak with a banker and investment advisor. I asked to make an appointment, but she said just show up, they don't do appointments.

I drive downtown, park and I'm greeted by another gatekeeper (the receptionist) who gives me a 15 second speech about the perks of a checking account. Then I tell her I want to open a business account and she grills me on if I'm filed correctly, do I have an EIN, etc.. (Basically trying to vet me). I just tell her it's a very well established company and I just need to speak to a banker about what Frost offers. She hands me a posted note with a phone number to call, and that nobody will meet with me there since I haven't ""gotten to that point yet"".

Good riddance Frost, I'll take my business elsewhere.Some of the worst customer service  I have ever dealt with. Went to Broadway Bank.Screw everything about this ‘Metropolis’ app required to park. You have to pay a service fee just to pay for the privilege to park.","Positives:

6,Frost Bank,"2421 E 7th St, Austin, TX 78702",Austin,"This ""New"" staff literally do not know what they are doing.. lobby was full of upset customers.. 3 customers requesting cash back while cashing/depositing a check, I was one of them. We were being told we could not receive cash back Incase the checks don't clear.. I've always been able to cash my check and take 100 cash at the same time. The banker had her manager come tell me I couldn't get cash back either that I would need to wait until my funds are available the following day.

I called customer service and they made the funds availableThe people at this branch aren’t very bright. I had a situation with a deposit that could have easily been explained to me. They behaved so strangely and suspiciously and would not explain what was going on. Was trying to open an account at frost- I’ll pass.This branch is great, the people there are great. Frost bank as a whole, however, is the worst banking experience I have ever had and it's not even close. Their systems lock you out of your online banking frequently, for inaccurate and bogus causes, and it happens quite often. I will never bank again with Frost.

NOTE: This branch very busy most of the time, but everyone still has a nice smile and they get their job done.Worst customer service ever from a manager.

12,Frost Bank,"2710 La Frontera Blvd, Round Rock, TX 78681",Austin,"I called the branch to open an account. The Branch Manager (last name Hernandez) happened to answer the phone. The short story is he was rude, argumentative and condescending. I'm filing a complaint with the corporate office tomorrow AND IM CDRTAINLY NOT OPENING AN ACCOUNT THERE... Beware!!! Read the reviews below... apparently my experience wasn't specific to me. Others have issues with the service too.I wish I would have switched to them so many years ago. I have been with a bank across the street for 18 years and I was worried about the paid of switching banks. My last bank fraud department said I was responsible for over ten thousand in fraud because they had a picture of my license.... Obviously that was enough to take the time to switch banks. It was a lot easier then I realized it would be. I even had a cookie while waiting. I started online before going in. I wanted to deposit cash and see what a transaction with a new bank was like. Super nice looking bank, very nice guy helping me walk through what to expect, and what he said about calling the customer service department was so exciting that I want to call to see if it could be like that. I write this with excitement because I am on the phone with the major blue bank across the street to try and dispute the resolution that having a picture of my id was not proof of anything. I was not in the location, sign anything, etc. So I am very excited to be at a bank where they will learn my name and not just another number. Oh and this guy must remember his  people pretty well. The woman in front of my had a haircut done and he was asking her if she liked it. It even through her off that he remembered the previous hair style or color.Very nice and professional staff. Ellie was able to help us out a few minutes after 5pm on Good Friday. We were so thankful because we drove an hour to get there. Thank you so much Ellie!Went into the La Frontera branch today to open a business account. Had the absolute pleasure of meeting Frost’s Banker of the Year (I'm assuming), Emily. She was SO nice - truly one of the most pleasant, informative, professional, personable encounters I've ever had.

I was recommended Frost Bank by my bookkeeper (which was also a good sign) and now I'm sure I'll be a customer for life.Tiffany would not cash a check a business entity that banked at Frost issued to us.  She took a copy of the check for some unknown reason but did not honor the check or resolve the issue. We left without our settlement amount awarded to us by the Frost customer. Tiffany did not go above and beyond.","Positives:

14,Frost Bank,"12532 FM2244 Suite 150, Bee Cave, TX 78738",Austin,"Drive one hour to this branch on a Saturday to open a new account. Daniel said he couldn’t do it because they were understaffed. He gave me major attitude. I love Frost Bank but Daniel is terrible!After Wells Fargo refused to help me exchange foreign currency because I was not a customer... I get it, policy is policy, but they were kinda rude about it. In a scramble, I googled and found this Frost nearby and it closed within 15 minutes. I explained what happened and much to my own embarrassment got emotional about my WF experience. Adele was kind and patient with me and managed to get the currency exchange done within 10 minutes and I was out the door before closing time. Wonderful.Very inconsistent practices. You can do something one week and they'll decide to change it the next. Drive thru is especially notorious for this.","Positives:

15,Wells Fargo Bank,"13749 Research Blvd, Austin, TX 78750",Austin,"Was in here over 30 minutes just to cash a check. I was super late to work; they need a better system to verify Wells Fargo checks not sure what takes so long when it was coming from a WF account. I’m so glad I don’t have WF as my actual bank.I'm not sure why there are so many bad reviews. I have been with Wells Fargo 10 years and this is by far the best treatment I have gotten at a branch, I was closing on a home and Amanda the Branch Manager was awesome!!!!!! all the tellers had a smile on their face and were patient and friendly. 5 star service, thank you !!!!Drive through ATM does not work! Whole reason I drove to this location was for that. Wells Fargo is not a good bank, I do like to have at least one brick and mortar bank though but I'll be switching elsewhere ASAP. Customer service on the phone can't even help with my debit card pin.The managers Katie and Charlie are professional and friendly. The bank has been knowledgeable and made my banking easy and timely. They know their business. Ana a teller has been extremely helpful and pleasant as has all of the tellers at this location.Excellent service and helping staff members .. looks like this branch is back in good hands now.DO NOT BANK WITH WELLS FARGO.

16,Wells Fargo Bank,"14063 US-183 Hwy, Austin, TX 78717",Austin,"I came here with my sister who was listed on my fathers account (since she’s the oldest) as POD (pay upon death). We arrived to her appointment and a woman came up to me smiling and asking if she could help. I was sitting and I said “Oh it’s my sister” and I gestured toward my sister standing in line, whom had turned around. She immediately turned to my sister and we both followed her to a seat in the bank. I said, “Im her sister, so I’m tagging along” and she just flippantly said “That’s fine” as she sat down….yeah half the money is mine, so ofcourse I’m going to be here… but she couldn’t care any less about me because I’m not listed on the bank account. So she proceeded to say directly to my sister “Im so sorry for your loss” and my sister thanked her.
I had a $25 check which needed to be deposited for my dad and the woman looks at my sister and says “I’ll see what I can do to get it cashed, I mean it’s only $25 so I’m sure it won’t break you” Are you serious??? It’s money owed to us, so that’s actually none of your business! It sure won’t break Wells Fargo to pay us our money.
So then we went through all the banking stuff to close the account. The woman never offered to tell us the exact balances in each account before starting the closure. She did not offer any statements which would have been nice to see what they were paying out. We had access to his account prior to us providing a death cert but they locked my sister out once they got that.
My dad has only us two daughters and we moved money from another account to Wells Fargo to pay out at once and because there is no POD on the other account. They would not pay us that money without a court order. Fine, that’s the law….but when my sister asked for a statement of the funds she looked like she didn’t think that was possible and then finally gave her one only of that one account. Listing the amount we don’t get.
Anyway the entire time I was this invisible person sitting there. I wanted to ask questions also but the process is that she is on the phone the entire time for approvals and she does all the asking of questions. Anyway, she wasn’t going to answer me anyway because I’m nobody in her eyes.
A coworker of hers came up to help and asked “Oh I’m sorry, who passed?” And this lady Jo Lynne or whatever answers “HER dad died”…she knew very well I was his kid too because she asked… but okay. I’m not important.
Then she gave my sister two checks, from his two accounts and did not give her any statements other than the one for the account we can’t have the funds from. So we don’t know if we were paid accurately or anything. There’s no proof! You’re PoD and they pay out but you get nothing to show the accounts balances? I mean that’s as SHADY as it gets!
As we went to the desk to get a $25 check cashed I was on my sisters right and the woman comes up on my sisters left, she touches her arm and says “And again, I’m So sorry for your loss”…. Didn’t even LOOK in my direction! Wow! As we left, I seriously started tearing up. It’s one thing to lose a parent but to be treated like a piece of trash because you aren’t the name on the account? I can tell you what, I have half the money now and guess where I will NEVER invest or bank it? Wells Fargo. You got it.
My sister hugged me, as we left. We’re both not gonna bank here.

Update: I just got mail from Wells Fargo stating that my father needs to deposit $500 to avoid fees on his account! They still have his $11k and if they take one dime for this I will take legal action. These accounts are supposed to be closed.I was very impressed with this location. Everyone is speedy and very good at their jobs, which seems to be a rare thing now.

Veronica Rodriguez was amazing. She deserves a raise.Had no issues with notarizing a document. Fast and convenient option for members.Which other bank forces customers to close a CD at a branch? Wells Fargo takes the cakeI’ve always come to this WF bank for all of my banking services that I need. My experience is always positive ones because the staffs here are really friendly, professional, and really nice people, they assist me in anyways they can. I decide that I have to write a review today for this bank because this bank deserve a positive review. I met Arthur Lopez today to close my Mother’s bank accounts. Mr. Lopez called me to reschedule so that he can help me to close bank accounts earlier than my initial appointment. He helped me close those accounts within a few minutes, then spend more time to discuss about business’ questions or concerns that I have since I shared with him that I am a new business owner. He is a premier banker who is really nice, helpful, knowledgeable, and went above and beyond to provide outstanding customer service. I highly recommend this bank!The banker Loriann is very professional and friendly in this bank.
My English is actually poor but she helped me to open account with patience.
Thnak you Loriann!Extremely rude tellers. They don't value your business. They just want to relax and get paid. Seems it's their retirement job. Don't go to this branch.DO NOT BANK WITH WELLS FARGO. They do not care about you as a person or a customer and will not help you if someone hacks into your account and steals your moneyAlways awesomeNice peopleToo bad... I just had a bad experience and I'm disappointed with Wells Fargo... I tried to withdraw money at ATMs and they gave me incomplete money, I was short 600 dollars, call customer service to make a complaint so they see what had happened with the machine and it turns out that they told me that there is no surplus money... this cannot be happening... is it really that money is lost in the machine? I still don't understand it","Positives:

- Friendly and professional staff
- Veronica Rodriguez was amazing and deserves a raise
- Arthur Lopez provided outstanding customer service and went above and beyond

17,Wells Fargo Bank,"10900 Research Blvd Ste B, Austin, TX 78759",Austin,"Please avoid Wells Fargo like the plague. They are in huge disarray. Speaking from 20 years experience, only recently had disaster after disaster with them. Terrible fraud that they won’t reimburse. Money is not safe there!!
UPDATE: WF finally reimbursed us the thousands of dollars from our terrible fraud experience (and hence I have raised rating one star) but the days and days of negotiation to convince them that they were clearly at fault was almost as painful as the actual fraud…grateful to have finally located an officer who recognized the obvious service gaps.Worst bank experience. For a simple wire transfer I’ve been waiting 50 minutes and counting
A piece of advise to Branch manager Casandra. If you are short staffed put a sign on the door or at least don’t tell customers the wait will be 15 minutes.   Your customers have work to do other than waiting 1 hr for a service that should not take more than 10 minutes to completeThis has to be the most poorly managed Wells Fargo branch in the country. GO ELSEWHERE. The manager is not only rude and incompetent, working more slowly than I have ever seen anyone work before, they encourage the same infuriating behavior in employees. I have waited 45 minutes to make a simple deposit in the drive through line on multiple occasions and each time they have been smug and unapologetic. Given the other negative reviews of this branch, it appears that I am not alone.Wrong advice. I went in there recently to ask questions to a banker and sort things out. I a simple question about how my credit card utilization could affect my credit score (They said it won't). A simple search online shows that it *does* affect credit score. How can a banker be wrong on something so simple?I have to get consistently poor service to write a bad review. This branch is no exception to my general experience: unmotivated staff, painfully slow service, and an attitude that suggests a complacency towards individual customers going all the way to the top. They may have stopped the widespread, predatory fraud, but the culture hasn't changed. And incidentally, I noticed that the last review complained about a long wait time in the drive-thru 5 months ago. I asked the teller today if my 20 plus minute wait with one car ahead of me was typical. She said, yes, this location only has one teller working the drive-thru. Case in point: as apologetic as management pretended to be for last reviewer's bad experience and in spite of the promise to thoroughly review the situation, nothing has changed. It's not the teller's fault: at least she was honest. I'm going to be moving my personal and business accounts to a bank that wants my business. Next time you're waiting in the drive-thru, at least you'll have plenty of time to write your own review.I will never come back to this location!!!  I have been there 3 times to open an account but failed as a new customer! The first time I was told to apply online and a clerk airdrop me a link. I have applied online but the system asked me to go to a local branch to provide more info. The second time I was there. The same clerk said they were busy and made an appointment for me but put wrong phone number. The third time I went there and was told they have contacted me with wrong number to inform me the appointment was cancelled because one of the clerk need to pick up kid and another has family emergency leave. They couldn't reach me but I did provided my email with the appointment. So they made another appointment to me at last. They shouldn't treat a new customer like this! Close this location please! SO DISAPPOINTED AND WASTE MY TIME!!!!Juan was nice enough to greet me at the door, and proceeded to tell me he has 1 teller, this manager did not get behind the counter, did not give at all a sincere apology, but more of a so sorry....  OR help out his only teller with a good size line. They either need to get staff, or not come up and ask you what you need. Seriously Wells Fargo this is not great.If I could give 0 stars I would. Had to come to this one due to them closing the other one in domain. Sent staff from domain here, you’d think that would be staffed closing several locations. NO! I waited ALMOST 2 HOURS in the commercial lane with only 5 cars in front of me. I wasted so much gas and time sitting there. Manger came out, not to apologize, but to tell me it’s gonna be like this for the next month. She was very rude. Will never come to this branch ever again. 0 stars.

Someone in higher management needs to do something soon!Why does it take over an hour on every bank to give my deposits to?

As business owner, I will encourage whoever reads this to not use this bank. I'm switching bank. Screw having to waste hours of my day just to make a deposit because these branches can't hire enough tellers.

And for that HL Casey guy who is gonna respond to this bad review, I will encourage you to stop wasting time responding to this message and use that time to hire staff.They closed the three WFs I used to use so have to go here.  You would think with all the others closed they would at least staff the remaining with tellers.  Came in to make deposit for two accounts (drive thru was closed).  1 teller.  I'm fourth in line.  In 20 mins moved 1 slot.  At least two others in the branch appear to be employees not real sure.  Finally left without making my deposits.  I'm going to have to eyeball the parking lot for my next trip to see when there are less cars and I can go in to close my accounts.Highly suggest not banking here unless you have hours everyday to make a deposit. Get in the drive thru line with one car in front of you and it will still takes over 40 minutes to make a deposit. And that’s when the drive thru line is even open. Wasn’t open all of March and the inside lines are worse. 0 stars. Sick of banking here.No one available to open a business account, seems like they fired all Bankers and only one person is available for several branches
You just have to wait about a month to have an appointment, so don't come here to open a Business Account use any Other Bank,
Sure and i will put my SS and card info too! Lol
Really u asking me to put public all these information
I been customer with you guys for more than 15yr, but that come to and End soonShould not be advising to open an account online. Two of us tried to open an account online but at halfway it gets denied and tell us we have to go to the bank to open an account. Stupid.DO NOT BANK HERE. This bank is the worst, they’ll let someone steal your money and then not even remotely try to help you get it back. Their claims department will just string you along for “10 business days” at a time, with no intention of ever approving your claim.Discriminatory management. Managers need to be audited. They always leave one teller to handle a bulk of the work while they use managerial duties as an excuse to sit on their hands.A huge shout out to Cassandra who went out of her way to help us out today. We hadNot good service at all. This type OSS service makes me wanna leave this bankThis is the second time I've come to this location during business hours and it's closed.Terribly understaffed","Positives:
- Juan greeted the customer at the door and was nice.

Do not recommend.In 2022, the only thing that makes traditional banks better than online banking is the benefit of a physical location. Since so many WF locations are ""temporarily closed,"" what's the point?

I promise it won't take very much longer before I terminate my account of 15 years, unless Wells Fargo goes back to actually servicing customers.

Seriously, you guys can't cash a check without an appointment???DO NOT BANK WITH WELLS FARGO. They do not care about you as a person or a customer, and will not help you if someone hacks into your account and steals your money, even if you report it right awayHorrible service.  I walked in and waited for 10 minutes for my turn.  And I was told: 1. we can’t help you without appointment.  2.

19,Wells Fargo Bank,"3601 Far W Blvd, Austin, TX 78731",Austin,"Would have rated zero, if it was allowed. Extremely rude tellers and bankers.
Outright disrespectful banker, when we wanted to open an bank account. The banker was least interested in opening my account, as if we were trying to defraud the bank. Added to this, the teller went away, as we were approaching him for deposits. Customer service is not a thing here. Stay away from this branch.I am student , I tried to come for three days , but they were not helpful . Just telling me to come tomorrow. They were not helpful . I didn’t liked it . There was not body . All the offices were empty . Didn’t had a good experience.
Wills Fargo has overall lazy service . I would not recommend it .The other week I had one of the worst customer service experiences I've ever had at any business. I originally saw Maggie and she was so sweet and so kind. Then a follow-up appointment I had the personal banker Aksana and she was SO incredibly rude, disrespectful, and impatient. Avoid at all costs.Im a Wells Fargo customer since 2013
I had to used thus branch a couple years ago and I had a good experience thanks wells fargoCould not have been a worse experience with this Far West Wells Fargo branch.

UPDTE : Not going to bother sending any of my contact information to WF to contact me back. You already lost my business. I can tell you, however, that it was your location on Far West Blvd, Austin, TX and it was with one of your bankers and not a teller experience.They do not answer the phone. At all. It tells you they are not available and then it hangs up on you. Just wow.The web site doesn't work.  Can't speak with an employee over the phone.  Frustrating beyond belief.  Will have to drive over there.Pretty happy with customer service if you go in and talk with someone, which I usually do. Could make it easier to reach the branch you want on the phone & get better with making sure all paperwork needed is consistent thorough all departments, but overall good .Single worst bank in austin been banking there for 6 months and im about to close my account today for a multitude of reasons. theyve flagged two of their own checks, been unable to help with withdrawals or deposits like 5 times, and i leave furious every time even when ive got a paycheck in my hand. Because most the time they are unable to turn that check into money due to some on the spot rule they, and no other banks, have. Dont waste your time or your money here bank ANYWHERE else.Several account problems of my own doing.  All problems quickly and efficiently rectified by Personal Banker.  Couldn't be more satisfied!Absolutely the worst bank! Their employees go above and beyond to not work ! They don’t answer phone, online system is down and they see you only by appointment!!

20,Wells Fargo Bank,"13000 N Interstate Hwy 35 Bldg 3, Austin, TX 78753",Austin,"The ATM is not working. Not  Today and is often not working.
Something that l haven't liked for years is that they don't allow you to use their restrooms. I think by law a business has to provide that service but they don't care about the public's needs.Absolutely the worst customer serviceHorrible service I’m have wellfargo over 20 years today I came for buy a cashier check only 5 people before me I’m wait for 1 hour the teller no had an experience I think I will change to different bank .. only one teller working.I have been with wells fargo since 1989, 80% time savings n checking, 20 % just checking,  today June 5,went to this branch early morning, cause I wanted to open a savings account for a secondtime,, I was told by the teller that they only do it by appointment,  and they didn't have any till july, she said I coul do online, I was there cause,  I wanted to do in person,, it was very upsetting to hear that,  I'm thinking about changing bank.I had been to two other Wells Fargos before visiting this one, desperately trying to complete a wire transfer to complete closing on a property I was buying with no luck due to staff shortages. Walked in and immediately got received the assistance I needed from Jessica. She was fast, professional and saved me from having to drive to additional locations! Appreciate yall.I haven’t done in person banking in a few years and I was nearby and came in to clearing a fee on my account. There was only 1 banker seeing people so it was understandable to wait as long as I did. Long story story, I met with Alex and she was able to identify the reason being my account was changed by someone or or the bank themselves (happened before) or someone else (unlikely). So there was a monthly fee I hadn’t been aware of but also a way to avoid it. She kept telling me “going forward now you know how to avoid the fee” which was understood the first time. The 3 or 4 times she repeated herself was just unnecessary. The most disappointing part was how dismissive she was, as to just get me away from her desk sooner. Telling me there’s nothing she can do and to call the fraud department and wrote a number down to send me away.

The teller I saw was nice and nothing to say but it was appreciated at dealing with someone who clearly had other things they wanted to do instead.Unfortunately, the past two times I’ve visited this location, I felt the service I received from Alexa Bazan was unsatisfactory.

The first time I was called by her to sit at her desk to fix an issue, she spoke to me in a manner of very passive aggressive. I let it roll off my shoulders and didn’t complain, obviously, I was there to receive help.

The second time however, even on my way to this store, I was already cringing seeing Alexa and hoping she wasn’t working / wouldn’t call on me. Well, she was there and she called on me. I was very polite (eeextra polite since I knew how I felt the first time around with her) from the very beginning, and just as usual, her attitude kicked in… and I seriously don’t know why. Was I not being nice???? Eventually, I respectfully told her I did not like the passive aggressive attitude and her service crumbled from there. She quickly told me she would not help me any longer and told me to call the 800 number on the back of my card. Yikes. All because I politely told you I didn’t like the passive aggressive attitude?

You should receive zero stars, Alexa. And you really need to learn some communication skills and stop talking to everyone like you’re a robot.Horrible customer service! Refused to provide change to a customer. Gives us as Hispanics a bad name due to poor customer service. Needs personel change.Terrible customer service. I waited for over an hour and the manager tells me you could have done this online. I was in the office to close my accounts and wire money to a new bank. Something one might preorder to do in person. One of the many reasons I’m leaving Wells Fargo.SUPER rude   I went in today to buy cashiers check and open a business checking account.  I was greeted at the door with a rude  woman that happened to be a teller.  Before I could enter the bank she stopped me asking if my had a drivers license and was it expired.  I was floored by her rudeness.  I will never EVER use Wells Fargo for anything.I Came by this branch to deposit a check for 24k. I sent them the check and asked how long and how much would be held. They said they couldn’t answer unless I deposited it. So I took my check down the street to RBFCU and they told me within 5 min without having to deposit it and I didn’t have to repeat myself every time I answered questions.

Wells Fargo Rips off their customers and they’re employees aren’t very helpful or they’re polices aren’t up to standards.Very very bad customer service and they don't know about bankingCame into wellsfargo on a very busy day and got helped out very quickly, the staff are very nice especially Roxy and Jessica the manager.SUPER SLOW! Do not stop at this bank if you are in a hurry. I've been sitting in drive through for over 5 minutes and have not moved, at all. I called to see if I could even do what I needed through the drive through and was told Lobby was closed (not enough staff).""We only have 1 banker and she's booked for the entire day."" Hire more bankers.Worst customer service ive ever seen at a bankFor debit cards issued in Korea, you can only withdraw in multiples of $20 and $50, and the fee is a whopping $5!!!

22,Wells Fargo Bank,"1601 W 35th St, Austin, TX 78703",Austin,"Wells Fargo is HORRIBLE.  Avoid it if you can.
The comment is not particular to this location, but applies to Wells Fargo's Practice in general.

I sent a wire to a friend who is also a Wells Fargo client due to an emergency.  The wire was sent on 6/7/2023, but my friend did not receive it.  We both on the phone to find out what happened.  After hours and hours with incompetent Wells Fargo support, no answers or solutions.  We were passed around within their support personnel like soccer balls.  Finally on 7/18/2023 I for the first time I got a Wells Fargo's call from a branch telling me that they will reverse the money back to me.  The call told me that it was NOT Wells Fargo's fault, it was the intermediate bank's fault.  The intermediate bank said they did not receive receipt's confirmation for information.  So eventually it is the customer's fault.  We have been desperately trying hours and hours to figure out what happened and what's needed, and nobody told us what to do and where the money is.  The wire money was withdrawn from my account on 6/7/2023 with a wire fee charged.  The money never showed up in the wire recipient's account ever.  After these many days finally it looks like the wire money might be reversed to my account.

Before the incident, I did not understand why banks were sued by their customers.  While dealing with this ordeal, I wished I were a lawyer so that I could take Wells Fargo to the court.

Anyway, be aware.  As a Wells Fargo customer, even if you have every transaction detail shown by Wells Fargo, your money could still disappear for months, and Wells Fargo does NOT care.  If you did not go after them, it's like you never had the money in the first place.

I would try to avoid Wells Fargo with any wire from now on.  If I can help, I will move away from Wells Fargo when it's time completely.
-----------------------------------------------------
I posted the above on 7/18/2023, and got a reply from Cedrick on 7/19/2023, which is today.  Thank you, Cedrick.  Your response came as a nice surprise after over month long struggle to just get my own money back without any real help.
I got a local call from a Wells Fargo branch on 7/18/2023 telling me that they received an email internally to refund the wire that the recipient never received.  I have been checking to see if the refund happened, but until at the moment of this writing the refund is still not in my account after 24 hour of the local Wells Fargo branch call.  I called and left a message this morning, and let's see what happened.  Wells Fargo, I need my money back to pay my college kid's tuition due this Friday!!!!
What a nightmare.  Wells Fargo takes away your money at lightning fast speed, but won't give it back after one and a half months when it failed to execute a simple wire transaction.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The unsuccessful wire made on 6/7/2023 was finally refunded back to my account on 7/24/2023 after one month and a half of hours and hours calling and on the phone with Wells Fargo.Staff is nice. Came here to see a banker and there were no bankers in the building. I spent an hour trying to get here and get an errand done on public transit. The person I called at the 800 number for WF said I could walk into any location to see a banker. There should be a flag for customers to find out somehow that some branches don’t provide all services.Hi,

For the record, don't leave bad reviews but had to leave one for this experience.,

Spoke to Ryan Anderson, the branch manager, and was extremely unprofessional. Tried calling him a good amount of times so I could get a payroll check pass through so I could pay my construction workers and got a response saying from him, ""IS THERE ANY EMERGENCY, IS THERE A PROBLEM???!!!"".

Ryan, for the record, you work for us, the account holders, who give you money for you to even hold a job. you work for us, not the other way around. Keep your attitude in check. If you can't handle the stress, I hear their hiring park rangers.

JaimeCame in at a time where there wasn't many people. However, this has been the best banking experience I've had. Quick and easy. Didn't spend more than 10 minutes at this location.They have plenty of employees yet everything takes forever.

23,Wells Fargo Bank,"9800 N Lamar Blvd Ste 100, Austin, TX 78753",Austin,"I arrived at the branch at approximately 11:50 AM. The customers' line at the branch waiting to be attended to by the bank tellers was very long, stretching outside of the bank door. Since I was there to see a banker to close my accounts, I entered and requested to see a banker. A female banker approached me and after telling her why I came to the bank, she asked me to wait because she had other people ahead of me. The banker advised me that it was going to take 20 to 25 minutes before she could attend to me. I told the banker I will wait. I waited in the lobby for about 35 to 40 minutes.  While waiting, at about 12:35 PM, I observed that the front door entrance to the bank has been locked. Then, customers determined to be served came through the bank door into the bank, but they were told mostly in Spanish that the bank was closed. This did not seem right as the bank was supposed to close at 1:00 PM.
At about 12:37 PM, a teller who had been standing behind the counter for 5 or so minutes, talking to her peers, decided she was going to help me. I showed the teller my photo ID on my phone and my debit card in hand. She refused to accept it, saying that it is the bank's rules that my ID must be handed to her in order to close my accounts. She suggested I come back the following week Monday. I advised her that the ID may be in my car and I do not understand why My ID photo on my phone was not sufficient proof of my identity. I left and went to my car.  On the floor in my car was my ID. Immediately, I returned to the bank at 12:40 PM, I was refused entrance by the manager and told once they locked the door for the day, they would not open it. Remember, this bank branch was opened for business till 1:00 PM. Most of these bank staff do not care about the customers' needs; it is always about what is for the best interest of the bankers. Customers do business at their own peril!Wellsfargo is the worst when I mean Worst I mean it ,they are so frustrating. I hope I never get to bank with such ever again.  you guys need to do better. Wellsfargo is draining I will never have a bank like this again I will make sure of thatWells Fargo sucks.  3 branches I've tried to visit are closed.

- The customer was able to retrieve their ID from their car and return to the branch within a short time frame.
- The customer appreciates the option to open an account at the branch.

- The line for the bank tellers was very long, indicating a potential need for more staff or faster service.
- One banker asked the customer to wait for a substantial amount of time before being attended to.
- The bank closing its doors early, without prior notice, caused confusion among customers.
- The bank's insistence on physically handing over the ID instead of accepting a photo on the customer's phone seems unnecessary.
- The manager refused entrance to the customer, despite the bank still being open.
- Multiple customers expressed frustrations with the bank, citing long wait times, poor customer service, and inconsistency in actions.

Miscellaneous:
- One customer expresses a positive sentiment about their experience in opening an account."
24,Wells Fargo Bank,"6208 McNeil Dr, Austin, TX 78729",Austin,"It is great to see this location is finally fully open after the pandemic shutdown. I worked with the lady at the service counter to conduct a detailed account review. She was extremely helpful and knowledgeable in advising me how to best utilize my accounts/services with WF. Towards the end of the review (30+ minutes), we discussed the location as now being open 5 days week. She shared with me that she was the Branch Manager of the location. Thank you WF for the great experience today.I was told I was not able to get more half dollar boxes if I didn't have a business account or deposit a considerable amount of money into that same business account. I was also told that the new fee for ordering boxes depends on my transaction amounts I do with that same account. I have been a customer for over 27 years and to hear this was disappointing. I went to another branch and they told me that was not true. They can order the boxes with their regular orders with no fees or restrictions. That new teller or banker at the Parmer and McNeil location is horrible with customer service and rude. I was pretty much treated like I was a nobody and was not welcome as a customer. Apparently, according to what she said, she was the branch manager. Embarrassing Wells Fargo.Went to location to be added to Safety Deposit Box. Office closed. Note on door with phone numbers to call. No answers the phones!  What's the point?This location is open 9am-Noon. Luckily there are several locations in the Austin area. I suggest anyone looking for a Wells Fargo to go to anyone but this location. Unless you have unlimited free time to guess when a banker in on duty.

May the odds be in your favor!I'm a wells fargo customer for almost 3 years .
Yesterday i was recommending this bank to a new friend.
When i took him there. I found a girl told me we need to take an appointment .
Today when i went there i called her saying that i will be late for 15 min.
She said okay no problem.  When i made it there she told me i started with someone who came earlier than his appointment and you need to wait for 20 min.
Now it's 2 hours and didn't receive anything from her.
I won't recommend this location  anymore.
And i'm seriously thinking to change my bank.I’ve come to this bank several times to find it closed, nothing posted on the door just not open and when is open, the drive up bank is closed most of the times.The Banker at this location was EXCEPTIONAL!

26,Wells Fargo Bank,"3216 W Braker Ln, Austin, TX 78758",Austin,"Wells Fargo is one of the, if not the, most corrupt institutions I have ever dealt with.  Wells Fargo has seemingly built their business model around generating fees and charges.

So glad there are other options.We had an amazing experience at the bank and our work was done immediately. The banker Sue J was very helpful and respected our time. I would recommend her for all your banking needs.Great customer service and very polite staff, special shout out to Sue J, who helped us with our banking needs. I would highly recommend banking at this branch of Wells Fargo.Just terrible. Slow, unhelpful, they might as well be replaced by AI. They only reason you have to go in is because of the restrictions they put on accounts. Everyone is sitting around not doing anything but you have to have an appointment to get help.Zero stars. Horrible customer service. Zero attentiveness of service if you don’t have an appointment. Long wait if you don’t have an appointment until someone is available.

I requested to use the ladies room and I was denied to use it because it was “only for employees” I was redirected to go to a café across street to use their public restroom instead of my bank restroom. That’s when I decided to leave without receiving any services nor allowed to use the restroom. I have been using online banking since pandemic day one and this is how my bank has greet me after three pandemic years. What a shame.Claudia and Alana provided excellent service as I needed to withdraw a large sum of money. They also listened to a.personal story of mine with grace.DO NOT BANK WITH WELLS FARGO. They have no interest in you as a person, let alone as a customer, they will actively help people steal your money with no intention of helping you get it back. Their claims department just strings you along, making it so too much time has passed for anything to actually be done about itThe bank I typically go to is closed,, and this location is just a pathetic excuse for a bank.
Only one person working and the line can take up to an hour for just three cars.
Management needs to hire more people.

It's hard to be believe it takes this long to give my money to someone.I took an appointment at 12:30 pm but they weren't able to assist me till 12:50 pm. There was no point taking an appointment and they are not taking walk-ins. At that time also the banker was helping 2 people at the same time and it took so long for a small work. Worst customer service.No one available to open a business account, seems like they fired all Bankers and only one person is available for several branches
You just have to wait about a month to have an appointment, so don't come here to open a Business Account use any Other BankI’m trying to just go in and close a safety deposit box, and I’m having to wait 30+ minutes as they only have 1 banker working. Bank has been temporarily closed for a while, you can’t schedule appointments online for this branch, and no one answers the phones. Horrible service and super inconvenient.Excessive wait times and incompetent employees. Stay away!Excellent service from the banking team and manager. It’s a pleasure doing business with people who care about their clients and have the utmost professionalism.Called branch to ask question before making appointment/trip. Never answers the phone. Get transferred to automated service which is useless.It's very unprofessional that the building is still closed. Especially when its thirty minutes or an hour later of opening time. Like come on it's not that hard to do open procedure's especially even if it's just one person doing it!!!Worst bank!

But the particular reason why I am so pleased with this WF is because of Tiva Lewis' service. She absolutely went out of her way to handle something for me that was very important for me, and time sensitive. I've never had a banker do such for me, and I am so incredibly grateful for Tiva's help and support when I needed it! Forever a Wells Fargo customer here!Laura was amazing. She was so friendly and explained everything to me. I definitely recommend this place.","Positives:

28,Wells Fargo Bank,"1601 W Parmer Ln, Austin, TX 78727",Austin,"I opened an account on Monday and had $5,000 wired to it (bank wire). I withdrew $1,200 on Tuesday with no issues. On Thursday, I went in to withdraw $2,000 and, for some reason, the teller needed his supervisor's ok on that. Chris came, did a few things on the computer, and later quickly said ""I'm Chris, I'm here to help with this transaction"" without even looking at me. They asked me for i.d., and after it was confirmed that I am the holder of this account, asked me to have a seat as they have to clear it with the back office. (What??). I waited for 15 minutes and then walked back up to the counter. The teller was still making calls, the supervisor is gone, but the branch manager was there. I asked the manager what the problem was, why I need to spend 20 minutes to withdraw my own funds from my account, and he said that they are just going by procedure and checking to make sure everything was allright. I explained there's nothing to check, money was deposited into my account, I am the account holder as they had verified by seeing my i.d. (which they were still holding!), so please give me my money and let me get on with my day. His snarky response was that I'm free to leave if I don't want to wait!!! Finally the teller informs the manager ""nothing on their end."" Nothing on their end?? Like what were they doing, making sure there was no criminal activity or something?

I do not appreciate the treatment that I experienced at all. They wasted 20 minutes of my time, they acted like this was suspicious activity and treated me as if I was guilty until proven innocent, and they were not in the least bit apologetic about it. The teller was nice and did actually apologize, but the supervisor and manager were extremely rude about all of this and really shouldn't be in a position where they are interacting with clients. I will be closing this account as soon as I withdraw the rest of my funds, as this treatment is totally unacceptable. From an ATM, of course, as I have no intention of ever setting foot inside of a Wells Fargo branch.

Worst. service. ever.
Train your managers, Wells Fargo!!The teller John has the poorest customer service. He just stares at you with no friendly smile. He doesn’t say “next” to let you know he’s ready for you. He doesn’t greet you when you do walk up. He speaks very low and seems to not like his job. He asked for two forms of I.D. and didn’t explain what I could provide as a proof of identification. Get a new job if you don’t like customer services! He also does not tell you goodbye have a good day or nothing.Useless customer service. Have wasted half a day on multiple occasions trying to get help with basic issues involving wire transfer and currency exchange. Really simple stuff that should take five minutes, you come here and wait two hours only to find they won't help with it at all.Second bank in a row today with no available bankers for a change on my accounts that I'm on a time crunch to get resolved. If you're not setup to take walk-ins ever you're not being effective. If I were a new customer looking for help with setting up new business with you, I would be going to another bank. Strongly considering taking my business to another bank because I'm not being taken care of.Impossible to get ahold of someone over the phone. Wells Fargo is the worst bank in existence. Don't do business with them.The people at this bank were extremely rude with zero compassion. They have zero interest in actually helping people with issues that their bank has caused and make it impossible to actually be able to get your problem solved. It makes me want to transfer to a different bank after being with Wells Fargo for decades.POOR COSTUMER SERVICE!!!
I would give them CERO starts if I could. I arrived 5-10 before 4pm, the bank closes at 5pm. After waiting for 15-20, a little after 4pm the fancy manager comes and with all her attitude and tells me that her bankers are busy working with people right now and that they close at 5pm. I said I could wait, so she gives me this looks and tells “AGAIN” that her people are busy and could not attend to me even if I was there more than an hour before closing. This is a bank that even of you are IN their lobby before 5pm will not take your business because they will not stay a minute after 5pm.
Way to go “manager” lady that is how you treat possible new business coming at the bank.Alexis Hernández is great and very knowledgeable! Very respectful, truly a great guy. Great experience 👍 …The guy in drive  thru commercial lane is rude and do not represent the company well .  Not even a hello just open the slot and take the money .  At first i thought he was having a bad day but this is a daily thing.I went to do a transaction and this  old lady her name is  Deborah  she started asking me  all kinds of ID evethough I am a customer without doing anything she was obnoxious to end it up telling me I have to make a appointment very frustrating 😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬 …No bankers in the office. Teller says non are available. This is a bank. Where are the bankers?Horrible operating hours.Thier ATM is often out of service. Hardly any service at this location for personal banking. Switching banks to a credit union.By far one of the worst locations. Insane slow linesI think it is a very bad experience that one has with these banks on a Saturday morning and practically almost all the banks are closed except for the one on west parmer lane. I arrived and stood in line and after 45 minutes waiting, they have no money, I cannot change. my check if this continues like this I don't know why they don't close those banks outright for a service like this it is better to close themIn this bank I had a not very pleasant experience, because the person who helped me, named John, was rude and seemed like he was angry or maybe he hates his job.Bad attention","Positives:

- The bank branch has an ATM available for withdrawals

She dotted her I's and crossed her T's and got it done.  Highly recommend Mecholah at this Westlake branch.

31,Wells Fargo Bank,"1201 Barbara Jordan Blvd BLDG 10, Austin, TX 78723",Austin,"Terrible experience. Staff needs more training. Branch is pretty but needs more staff. They made us schedule an appointment to open account two weeks later we showed up and the lady was nitpicking our forms. There was nothing wrong with the forms. We drove across town to a competing bank and they completed the opening of the account no problem. Bye Wells Fargo 👋I will preface this with I have no complaints about the staff, they are always friendly and helpful.

The branch however is the most inconsistent one I have banked at in the 20+ years I've been with Wells Fargo, I will frequently pull up during business hours only to find they are not open, and as it is their hours are insufficient to service the community they are in. Show up at any time on Saturday and they will literally have a line out the door. But they still close at noon.Thanks to get me through wire transfer process quickly and professionally without appointment on Saturday! It was awesome! Great to meet such employees!Worst customer service in motor bank! After being parked in line for over 20 mins (got in line at 11:50) teller Vanessa M. refused to help me deposit a check because, according to her they were already closed. I explained I got in line in time but she still refused helping me.Maribel was very nice and helpful. Thank you for making it a quick and easy service today.There’s no one working here during the hours posted. When is someone actually working at the bank?They require an appointment to go into the bank but they won't answer the phone so you can make ""Said"" appointment. I've read the other reviews and I'm surprised that corporate offices haven't put this branch on an improvement plan or changed out the staff.Bank hours online and posted on the doors say they open at 9, there were also employees behind the counter but yet the doors were locked and drive threw was closed. It was 9:20 am. When i knocked on the doir the just stared at me and went about there business, then when i pulled threw the drive thru to see why they still werent open they proceeded to ignore me. I will not be returning to this wells fargo, dont bother driving out of your way to come here, because they apparently dont feel like opening when they are suppose to! Absolutely rediculous!!Have come to this branch for various purposes and the staff have always been extremely courteous, accommodating, efficient and honest. They always set clear expectations about the wait time, what information is needed etc. Reliable center.
(Never done a drive through in this location, always in person)Maribel was incredibly helpful. Highly recommended going to her for your banking services.Guadalupe was so helpful, friendly, and made sure to leave me a voicemail when my issue was resolved. I always want to work with her!contactless readers  on both ATM's arent working. this is why i have a wells fargo account and keep 0 dollars in itOne of the worst banks in the country the people that work there are rude and have  very ugly attitudes and it’s super hard to get a loan here even if you have great credit. Take your money somewhere elseThe reception so rude I want to open new account she told me go on line to open it otherwise you have to call and schedule your appointmentNo one ever answers the phone. Now I have to drive over there, stand around in the lobby and wait forever because they are super-slow here, to ask a simple question about foreign currency.Worst customer service of any Wells Fargo I have ever been toThis place is terrible.

32,Wells Fargo Bank,"2326 S Congress Ave, Austin, TX 78704",Austin,"My uncle went to this location today. The ‘manager’ greeted him and began helping him. After she sat me down on her office she walked off to go help translate for another customer that was behind my uncle in line. My uncle asked her to finish helping him first as they were almost done with what he came in for (not to mention he was mid sentence when she walked off). She abruptly told him ‘you can cancel Bill Pay online, you don’t have to come in person to do this,  or we have other locations you can go to if you don’t want to wait, because it is my job to translate for our employees that aren’t bilingual.’ My uncle waited another 5 or 6 minutes before she came back and completed the transaction (which took less than a minute) and handed him the receipt, did not say thank you, did not say anything! If he knew how to do it online then he would have, that is the exact reason he made a trip to the bank to help him!I came to this bank today to get information about my account. According to Google Map, the closing time of the bank was 5 o'clock. This employee closed the door for no reason she is very rude and behaved very badly.Brought in some damaged bills and they would only replace $20 without being able to prove an account there. Took longer to say no than to just perform the service. Very unlikely to do business with Wells Fargo in the future if this is going to be the way they treat prospective customers.","Positives:
- The manager greeted the customer and began helping them.
- The transaction was completed quickly.

Room for improvement:
- The manager left the customer mid-sentence to help another customer, which caused frustration.
- The manager abruptly told the customer that they could handle their request online, without providing much assistance.
- The manager did not express gratitude or provide any positive customer service.

Miscellaneous:
- The customer had a negative experience with an employee who closed the door before closing time, stating that they were rude and behaved badly.
- Another customer had a negative experience when they brought in damaged bills and were only able to replace a portion without proving an account with the bank.
- The negative experiences mentioned may impact the customer's willingness to do business with the bank in the future."

Either improve your operations or hire more people or both.I went in Wells Fargo to shut down my account, honestly kinda sad I was shutting it down because I wish I had a reason to go back. The banker who helped me, Oscar Ramos, was so kind and made the entire process so easy. I have never had such an amazing banking experience. 10/10 would recommend. Thank you @Oscar, you have raised my standards and made my whole day.Wells Fargo makes its customer wait on them instead of serving their customers and waiting on them. 0 out of 5 stars.

Their online portal is buggy and one can then not easily report SEVERE defects in their software. One incidence, they hardcoded an email I no longer use into their online loan heloc application. One can not change it. Cant contact them about this easily online, get put in a loop on the phone. Surely they are sending reminders to this email address (which I no longer control) to complete the loan application. Classaction Privacy Lawsuit?

I give them 0 out of 5 stars. Overall 0 out of 5 stars after being a customer for 20+ years. Online banking without being able to actually contact them online, you have to call them.

Im from out of state and this location and its manager took the extra steps to get my wallet back to me out of state. Amazing customer service!I have banked at Wells Fargo for more than a decade, and in that time I have never received customer service so horrible as this location. The manager, I believe her name in Alejandra, has been borderline disrespectful to me on two separate instances, and I have witnessed her speak with attitude and malice to other customers while I’ve been in the branch.

Quick quips pushing online service over fact-to-face help is her go to. This time, I was trying to send a wire of funds above the online-allowed amount and she informed me my only option was an online transfer to to make an appointment with a banker. When I asked to make an appointment she directed me to call Wells Fargo’s main line and there were no banker appointments for two weeks, although my wire had a quick-turn deadline.

I will never visit this location again, but do recommend driving the extra distance to the location on Pleasant Valley and Riverside.

They helped me quickly and happily and we’re also so informative.The ba,k is easy access and protected for your own safety.6/5 @ 11:23am Huge line.

Then was told that they couldn't find my appointment. I was told to wait for a cancelation. Another hour passed and was told that there were no cancelations. I was told to go online and schedule another appointment.Every current or old advertisement towards wells fargo ends at this location.Fraudsters who skirt the law every opportunity they’re given.

39,Wells Fargo Bank,"1000 E 11th St, Austin, TX 78702",Austin,"I had the best banking experience here.  Tiva was kind, helpful, and took me through everything thoroughly and comprehensively.  She was so kind it brought me to tears - literally. If you want to work with a real human for your banking needs, go see her at this location.Worst customer service experience EVER. I went to open a new account with a banker called Asi and gave him information with a code to take advantage of a promotion to get 200 dollars for opening a new account. He told me that he did. Just today i called to check the status and the branch told me that it was not added. I spoke to Sergio who lied and said he was a branch manager and was rude, very condescending sounding over the phone, then keep talking over me and when I began to get upset and correct him, he hung up on me. I recorded the call and will be forwarding it to the correct department that handles these type of issues and takes action. I also emailed the district manager but no responseThis was the 3rd Wells Fargo that I had gone to today.  I was mentally exhausted when I walked in. I had asked to speak to an assistant the young lady said she didn't have an appointment at the time but she had one open at 3:30 & if I didn't mind waiting she could help me. I was so happy, she helped me resolve an issue that I have been dealing with for months!  Her name is Tiva, she was so kind, so patient, took her time,  didn't rush me out of the bank, it just meant the world to me! I thanked her at least three or four times lol but I just wanted to thank her one more time!Horrible bank and personal very rudeTiva is the worst.  How is this woman employed.  Such a depressing situation.","Positives:

44,Wells Fargo Bank,"161 W Slaughter Ln Unit N, Austin, TX 78748",Austin,"It’s one of my good locations of Wells Fargo and they have a very good customer service. They have a friendly team friendly team, the transactions when I am transferring locally I like there are management they provide very good Customer Service, highly recommended 👍
Also, I recommend a credit cards were good points, especially the travel credit card 👍If I could give this branch zero stars, I would most certainly do it. I’ve been a member of Wells Fargo for nearly 7 years now, and have never had any issues with depositing checks until now first time and last time I’ve ever come to this location they tried to put a seven day hold on my check that I was trying to deposit, I’ve deposited much larger checks in the past from the same account holder With no problems. Yet this branch was trying to play games with me. After looking at other reviews of similar issues. I feel like I’ve come to the conclusion that the people that work in this branch are racist towards white people. I I almost closed my account over this I’m glad I didn’t with a little more dignity. I just took my stuff to a different location and deposited the check and it was ready the next business day rather than putting a seven day hold on it ridiculous wasted an hour and a half of my time, I’ll because they think it’s funny to jack around with people.I have burned about an hour trying to withdraw a c-note from my account. Went inside, thinking that it would be faster. 2 tellers. One dealt with a single customer for the 25 minutes I stood there. Still there when I left. The other teller began dealing with a customer who was still there when I left. I would be fired for operating so inefficiently.Took the banker +2hrs to open a business account. We should have asked for a different banker when she introduced herself and followed up with, ""I've never done this."" She read through protocols while we waited. I don't understand why someone training was allowed to lead. Our appointment was for 4 we didn't leave until after 6. We had to fill out more forms because errors were committed when creating the account. There were two other senior bankers ""walking"" her through the process. This was the worst banking experience. I should have gone to a different branch.Awful! Completely understaffed,  gonna take 30 minutes to do any transaction.  Drive thru is an hour wait.

I enquired about moving some of my money around in my accounts. Teller tells me that all their people are busy, but they will take my information and give it to someone,  they will call me. We'll, that was about a month ago, never heard from them. It is a completely incompetent branch.I don’t leave many negative reviews, but this bank wastes 45-60 minutes of my life every visit. Figure it outIf you want a good experience with Wells Fargo, go elsewhere. These people lack human decency and are unwilling to work with people. Their blind obedience to the rules their corporate masters pass down only benefits those corporate entities while leaving customers with less and less options. I should have known when the manager came out wearing a mask..  in August of 2022, that he was unable to think for himself. Went to another Wells Fargo and they let me deposit into my mother's account, no problem because..hmmm why the heck not. ..!.,Hands down the worst Wells Fargo.  Short staffed and sloooowwewThis location needs to work on their time allowance per customer.
Waited in line an hour.
(Commercial lane)
Saturday morning because they close at noon which also needs to be changed for the consideration of the customer
For an 8 minute transaction !They could be voted the slowest drive thru ever. 20 minutes crazyExtremely slow, even if there is no line it still takes a minimum of 10 minutes to deposit a single check when other banks in the 21st century can do it in seconds. Also, 21st century banks have much better hours. If I work a 9-5 job when the heII am I supposed to do my banking? And no walk-ins! If you don't own a car they won't see you at the drive-thru. Unacceptable class discrimination. Even if you manage to get a ride they might place traffic cones in front of your vehicle at 4:50 and tell you to go away!I had a bad experience with the banker Monica. She was not welcoming at all and didn't even offer us to take a seat. We will not be back to the slaughter Ln location.
Monica needs to work on improving her customer service.Just a heads up for everyone. Apparently they close 40 mins before their written hours on Saturday. Doors were locked and no one was at the Drive Thru.Prepare to wait in line, if walk-in service necessary.  2 tellers at most usuallyBe careful if you cash out large amount of money $$$  someone will watch you and smash your auto to steal everything you have. They did not do nothing about it. It happened to me today Nov 3rd 2pm. Watch Suspects inside branch..Came to cashier my check and they dont wanna because they want i have a busines account, i was cashier my check every time on ather wels fargo banks before, keep away from hereThe banker had only one reply for my all different questions.
I don't know how to do! 😄 …Excellent customer service with the teller that handled my transaction. Improvements have been made from my last visit.Horrible service! No tellers. Long wait time!The new teller was very helpful and friendlyVery slow and poor service!New person working is faster !!Very badly I came with my husband to have money changed from small bills to only 100 and keeping my accounts very well I missed 595 dollars. But once they were inside they counted one in front of me and another person said I count the other part and that's where I didn't look. They just said it's so much.Very bad service","Positives:

Today, although there were plenty of people inside the bank working, all drive through lanes were closed. Their hours are never followed, it is beyond inconvenient.

Everyone is always extremely helpful and welcoming. It's also nice on the inside, a bit of a reminder of the old Bee Cave with the mural.Made an appointment. When I arrived, no one addressed me, so I got in line for the teller. I let her know I had made an appointment, but was in need of exchanging currency. She asked me to insert my card and I let her know I wasn't a customer but that my bank had recommended them since they don't do currency exchange. She simply said ""Oh, you have to be a customer."" So I asked if she had a recommendation for somewhere else that may be able to help and she just said no. Call me crazy, but that could've been a sales opportunity. Any kindness or offer of help is so important in a customer facing role. After this interaction, I will NEVER be a WF customer.One Wells Fargo branch open in western travis county on saturday. There must be fifty to a hundred people in the lobby and all the drive up lanes are full.This branch doesn't seem to respect appointments, and leaves customers waiting, a repeating problem seemingly as well, when one checks other reviews. It's also basic SoP for a bank to have someone at the door to help you or notify employees that their appointment has arrived, this branch has employees who glare at you, and forces you to go to the till to inform them you are there for an appointment.

The only employee to actually take initiative was an elderly gentleman with glasses, though a fair amount of my time had been wasted already.

Quite disappointing.Met with Joe today on the business side, and he was super helpful in getting our accounts updated with various needs. Really took his time to get everything done well and was appreciated. Seemed like a nice branch office to do banking at overall.The worst banking experience of my life.","Positives:

She went above and beyond for me while their AC was out on a 106 degree day. She exudes what customer service should look like in all businesses. Wells Fargo is lucky to have employees like Katie who make banking here worth it.Very poor (rather worst) turn around time for any customer service. Getting into the line explain itself is the pain point. Hopefully in future they improve the wait time for the customer service in the future.The staff is very nice. There was no line, so it was very fast service.Wells Fargo is the worst bank ever. They have become the 7-11 of banks and no one there knows anything about banking or finance. They are check cashier's and that's about it. I had noticed my bank account had these charges on it and went into my branch and was told anytime I called in with a question they seemed could have been answered by self online they charge me for $3.00 What a joke and a scam. You know Wellssfargo has been Federally proscuted for setting up fake accounts to charge customers unauthorized fees

My. Business bankwas boughtuby Wells Fargo and it went from banking professionals to dealing with idiots. Other than having many branches for convenience there is no benefit to wellssfargo.Rude smug you have to have an appt you have to show up before 4pm and they will leave you sitting for 40 mins until they close just to tell you they're not going to help you. Nothing is posted about their rules. Worst branch ever!I have a business account with Wells Fargo and deposit a cashier's check every week at this location. Yesterday, I went in with cash to make a cashier's check and was instructed to return only when I had two IDs, which is undqerstable because maybe that is their policy. The teller was unnecessarily rude and condescending, I felt unwelcomed here.Please fix your ATM. For the last six months, whenever I have tried it has only ever had money once. Front desk staff is great, but they do not call back.Pathetic service. Had to wait 30 minutes for some one to ask why I am there . Exploiting the Covid situation still . Employees are more into thier lunch breaks than customers. Plan to move all account out soon.The absolute worse maintained ATM out of all the Wells Fargos in the area. Constantly something wrong with it. It's a new machine with the same issues. VERY frustrating!DO NOT BANK WITH WELLS FARGO, they do not care about you as a person or a customer and will not help you when you have gotten your account hacked and your money stolen even when you report it right awayIt’s been 3 weeks already every time I come the ATM does not take cash deposits or withdrawalsPoor serviceThey fixed the ATM!Worst customer serviceMy fiancé and I had a very pleasant experience at this location.

She was amazing, She called me at my request online and went over everything I needed to bring, before our meeting. I showed up at the branch and was greeted and taken to her office. The  Result?: I switched over all my accounts, personal and Business, Very valuable Banker. I opened my business and personal account with them today. 10-stars Shay! Go Chase for hiring very talented and professional bankers ! 👍🙏🏼🏆1000% Agree to the reviews. Really bad chase customer service. I've never ever experienced such service in chase. I didn't had an appointment so I waited, they have me wait additional 5 to 10 minutes approx. Just to tell me that everyone is booked. NO GREETINGS! NO SMILE! NO FRIENDLY BEHAVIOR, NOTHING. And this service is from Bank MANAGER, so nothing can be expected from other employees working here. Horrible service.Went to Chase to get a check from a Chase customer cashed and was told that I would need to go to larger Chase bank to get a $2500 insurance check cashed.  Then the next excuse was, they couldn't cash the check because I wasn't a Chase customer. She said the couldn't verify if the funds were there (which basically told us that Chase wrote us a check that was no good if they wouldn't cash THEIR own check). We then went to our own bank next door and had them cash it. We'll NEVER set foot back in Chase Bank and after reading all these reviews I'm surprised these people still have jobs.Great bank. They take care of their customers.Some of the staff I have interacted with a year ago at this Chase branch were quite polite and helpful. Don’t know if COVID has impacted their staff quality. Both the ladies I interacted with recently were quite rude and absolutely not helpful. Makes me rethink my banking options. If I should anyway rely on virtual banking why go with Chase.

Completely agree with others who have reviewed- they don’t answer the phone and do everything to avoid work. The lady, Tasleem, who we interacted with did everything to avoid work. They need to relearn what customer service really is.Seriously, read the reviews. Worst customer service from a Chase bank I have ever received.

Simple deposit into my IRA, was told to wait in the lobby for a banker. 15-20 minutes later was told the person who handles IRAs was out and won’t be in for another 15 minutes. That’s not something I could have been told from the start?I would like to thank Sammy Ybarra on his support today. The staff greeted me, set expectations on the wait and they did a great job of helping me resolve my issue in a timely matter. Thank you for your service Mr. Ybarra. Well done.I will change my business account I will go back to bank off American .

Can never get my own $$ out they claim not carry that much cash, totally useless , DO NOT BANK with this branchThis branch is a joke. Waited for customer service people for 30min.

50,Chase Bank,"12222 Research Blvd, Austin, TX 78759",Austin,"Christopher L. Garcia helped a friend. He was super! His memory was sharp and he knew who to contact to take care of business. He was polite and so personable. His kindness warms my heart.

Additionally, there seems to be wonderful camaraderie in that office as I see them do their best to help Chase clients. Thank you!Aurora, thank you for answering the phone with such a pleasant disposition and being knowledgeable about your scheduled appointments. I am parked at the CHASE by McNeil drive and the two fremale bankers there had no one in the facility and did not try and help AT ALL... instead they asked me to look in Google for other banks and look for appointments... everything is redirected to the website so why are we paying the 2 women at this branch to just sit there and be condescending to customers. Aurora at the Research location took care of me over the phone in less than 2 min...WOW...Absolute worst experience at a bank ever. My money blew out of the drive-thru window because the teller was ignoring me despite knowing I was trying to make a deposit. While I was scrambling around and trying to catch the bills, she kept haranguing me to come get my ID. I finally had to tell her I was coming right back.

When I returned to the window, I realized I was forty dollars short and she very rudely told me to use the clip this time (I used it and my money still blew away.)

I managed to find all but $20. I went into the bank and that same teller told me the manager wasn’t there and refused to tell me what branch they were at today. Then she also made sure to try to cover her behind and insisted she just told me to use the clip (a lie).

I finally had to get pushy and she let me speak to someone in charge. This person, Sima, was at least polite and helpful. However, in the middle of finally getting some help, the rude teller marched over and informed me that I was lying about the amount of money I was trying to deposit. It should be noted Sima had the exact amount I was claiming minus the twenty dollars.

Yeah, so if you want to deal with neglectful tellers who then go out of your way to try to get you in trouble while someone else is fixing their mistake, this is the branch for you. If you want competence, politeness, and employees that don’t accuse you of trying to cheat the bank, maybe don’t use Chase of this is the caliber of employee they hire.15min to withdraw money from the drive through.

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Went in for a name change on my account, which only takes a few minutes. The only banker working there told me to go to another Chase since I didn’t have an appointment. The last time I checked, “appointment only” has never been a requirement to be seen by a banker. It was clear that she didn’t want to help me and this location is extremely short staffed.Raul and Shirin at this Chase, have been exceptional in every aspect. Raul's financial expertise, commitment to customer service, and dedication to helping me achieve my financial goals have made my banking experience truly outstanding. Raul's guidance and support have been invaluable, and I feel fortunate to have him as my advisor at Chase. Thank you, Raul and Shirin, for your excellent service!The worst customer service ever, mainly because they are so understaffed. Had to wait for their Private Client side to conduct a wire for me for when I used to be able to do it at the counter. No one ever checked to see that I was still waiting there for 40 minutes before I just left for another location.It's ok. Sometimes they have someone standing in front asking what you are there for which is annoying.  Like, I'm just making a deposit.Somebody offered to help when I walked in and was very nice, and the teller was nice too.When I open bank account they was so helpful. They helped me to prepare all documents and I get account really fast.Tried to do business at this bank. There was one teller servicing the front counter and the drive-through. There were four people waiting ahead of me and three cars in the drive-through.

I asked the branch manager if there was only one teller. She said yes. She asked what I needed I said I need to see the teller and I don’t have time to wait.

There were plenty of other employees who could’ve assistant. 🤷‍♂️

I went to a different Chase branch and was taken care of almost immediately…. Except they need my ID to take your cash payment. Lol. I own the business and we take cash… No ID needed. 😂Every teller has a different way of doing their work.  Some won’t take more than one deposit and make you use the night drop, some need an ID to exchange cash for coins, some won’t give you coins, they are so inconsistent and quite rude, but they never forget to wish you a good day.  I wish they would get their story straight, train their team, and be more helpful.They could use more employees. There is only one associate working on a Monday afternoon, and a lady who appears to be in charge recommends to those waiting to go to another location.Wanted to setup an account, I was late for my appointment with Leroy chambers. He walked up and told me he is not Free and started asking me what is my nationality and etc . Definitely not very welcoming and terrible experience .I have chase bank and walked in to open a savings account and they told me that it would be three weeks before they could do it bc I didn’t make an appointment. LOL there were 3 tellers sitting at their desks and NO ONE in the bank. This place is a joke.I opened checking account online, and when I receive my card, tried to activate, but the site saying my account is restricted, called them and was told to came to branch in person, I came to this branch, and here they saying they have no bankers, I have to go to another branch, and staff could not tell me exact branch name I have to go, W.T.F is this?

The worst customer care and the worst bank👎👎👎👎👎👎Had an amazing experience with Raul today! Super easy to talk to and answered my questions thoroughly. Thanks for helping us with our account!Always friendly, helpful and quick service whenever I’ve been inside!this place doesn't know-how to answer the phoneIt is not possible that a simple deposit was made incorrectly and they took a long time to serve me at the drive-thru. If it is a business account, how can they deposit in another account and not realize that the name of the beneficiary does not correspond and also if my writing is very wrong and they do not understand it because they do not have the delicacy to ask to confirm if this is the case, then it is better to deposit in cashier that is a machine","Positives:

It would be helpful to see live security present or cameras on the perimeter of the building. All the team provide nice customer service and they are fast at this branch.Avoid this branch. Go to the Spicewood location and Jose Banda will assist you.

This branch has several employees sitting at their desk not assisting any customers. I made an appointment with one of their bankers after not being helped the previous day. The banker failed to notify their customers that their appointments are cancelled for that day.Minor is great man, one of the best managers I ever met, he goes beyond his duty to help you

Especially Andrew, I believe he is the Assistant Vice President, was really helpful and opened an account for me and consulted on various questions extremely well. Definitely recommend!Never answers the phone. Ever. Got transferred to a useless automated system.The teller was friendly but the policy to only  cash checks less than 2500 really caused issues for me and my family. I do not have a Chase account and after this experience I do not want one.","Positives:
- Friendly and professional staff
- Andrew, the Assistant Vice President, was helpful and provided good consultation
- Opened an account and answered various questions well

Room for improvement:
- Poor phone service with no one answering the phone
- Useless automated system for transfers
- Restrictive policy on cashing checks over $2500 causing issues

Miscellaneous:
- Negative experience with the branch led to the decision of not wanting a Chase account."
54,Chase Bank,"1700 W Parmer Ln Ste 3, Austin, TX 78727",Austin,"Worst bank ever, closed my account because of missing information without even letting me know. They didn't email, call, text or mail. Closed the account and waited for me to notice, I wasted hours on the phone trying to understand what they need from me, all they have to say is I should reapply.
I had amazing credit, they waisted my time and ruined my credit now as well. STAY AWAY!Slow wait times to talk to a banker, service is just okay. Worth the drive to go to a different location if you’re needing anything other than to make a deposit/withdraw.Today I had a scheduled meeting with Dipo at noon. Once I arrived, I notified the teller I was there to meet Dipo and she went and told him. After 20 minutes of waiting, I still hadn't heard from Dipo. Therefore, I asked the teller to notify Dipo that I was still waiting (she was also surprised he hadn't come to get me yet...).

Finally Dipo comes out at 12:26 and tells me it was going to be ""a few more minutes"" (Remember my appointment was at noon.) I told him that this was unacceptable and that I was leaving.

I have been a Chase customer for over 10 years and this is by far the worst customer service experience I've had. If you're the Branch Manager reading this, have a serious conversation with Dipo about how to value and respect your customers' time. I was hoping to open a business checking account with Chase but now will be doing it elsewhere.I’ve banked with Chase for over a decade. I’ve been to a lot of branches with friendly people, but this one is certainly one of the best experiences I’ve ever had. The entire staff is incredibly helpful and the manager makes an effort to speak to customers in line to help them out or even get to know them. I can’t begin to describe how pleasant of an experience this branch is.They have 2 old ATM and it seem to NEVER WORK! And the line seem to be ALWAY LONG @ChaseBank please get new ATMs.Went there to close my business account. It was done in 5 minutes and lady who took care of me was super nice. I recommend this location.Be aware. These ATM machines are usually always broken. Been going to this one for 3 years... won't changeAlly was amazing today with my transaction ordering/exchanging money into foreign currency. She was knowledgeable, patient with all my questions, and even gave me literature to leave with regarding foreign transaction fees. I was also greeted as I waited in line! I'd definitely come back to this location.My chase account was opened here the woman who opened my account was patiently listening to me answered all my questions. She was very humble Saturday that’s was my last token to take in thanks I didn’t forget you. Time is moving fast thanks once again.DO NOT USE CHASE. They are terrible. They take your funds and use your money for options trading and investments rather than allowing you to use your money. They usually hold your funds for 10 days after they receive them from other institutions. They are purely an evil, greedy bank.Branch manager there needs to learn how to use indoor voice when talking and engaging with customers. There are times when questions about Chase accounts that are strictly confidential. I felt very uneasy asking questions when he let the world knows about my accounts.Whoever is responsible for this bank's security is extremely stupid and wholly incompetent. Cameras go IN FRONT OF!! The windshield so that the driver and passenger can be clearly seen. Whoever mounted this camera at the back of the drive-thru should be immediately FIRED!  They have no idea what they're doing.This location has a lot of issues and Chase shows no concern about a location that has no problem with being unprofessional and downright rude to customers.  Their actions are illegal and violate banking laws. Manager called me this morning started off with mispronouncing my name and it went bad and worse from that point, he said that he has personal issues, don't we all.The service is so bad ，I waiting for a long time and I call them .No anyone help meDipo is the best!!! He called 2 hours ahead to make sure we will bring everything we need, after finding out I can’t get joint account , he gave us solutions and help us out patiently, definitely will come back to this location if we have any future need.Employees are always very nice!  There was a short wait at the drive-thru but everything went smoothly.They got my number and told you will get a call and I never received the call nor they said my appointment is scheduled for xxx day and time . Branch is not recommendedI was helped by someone named Thor. He answered all my questions and was very friendly and patient with me.Only 3 branches in Austin Texas. Completely unacceptable and poor business practices.Worst customer service.better be away from the particular branch.👍🏾 …","Positives:

56,Chase Bank,"9901 N Lamar Blvd, Austin, TX 78753",Austin,"Elva M Mondshine was very rude! She spoke to my friend and I very aggressive! I have been a chase member for over 4 years and every time I have gone to other branches they have never spoken to me this way. My friend would ask me a question and she would be so rude as in to tell her don’t ask her anything ask me everything and it was a simple question. Once she got so aggressive I told her she can calm down it was a simple question and she tried to kick me out of the office. Chase on Lamar really needs to train their employees to be patient, respectful, and friendly. If someone is accompanied by someone is probably because they want them to be there not just for giggles. Made us feel very uncomfortable and personally will never go back to this branch. A banker is supposed to make you feel comfortable to ask questions.I just moved into the area decided to open a Chase account online after receiving my debit card I decided to go into my local branch this location. Upon walking into the building I noticed there were zero people in line I was actually excited about that made it to the front  two tellers sitting there talking to each other completely ignored me looked at me a couple times and still did not acknowledge me I had to ask them if it was okay for me to approach. I think these people forget that they're in the customer service industry. You guys are ghetto trash!Angie  is so helpful! We had a check issue cause by Chase backend system and had to go to the branch 3 times. Angie helped us contact Chase team and solved our problem perfectly!Don’t bother coming here it’s always like thisUnsafe location. There are not a lot of parking spaces except in the back but there’s community of homeless people right there. if I’m going to deposit thousand dollars in the bank, that’s not where I want to park.Generally one of the worst banks ever. Literally the worst chain bank location I’ve ever visited in my life. Homeless encampment and unpermitted businesses conducted all around the bank. Very dangerous vibe. ATMs never work. Everything is filthy. Rude and sarcastic staff. I guess poor people money doesn’t matter to CHASEChase is a HORRIBLE bank. Don't waste your time or money opening an account with them.$10 fee to cash a $100 check from your own bank?Convenient location.  Good service.

- Angie is helpful and resolved a check issue caused by Chase's backend system.
- Convenient location.

57,Chase Bank,"6301 W Parmer Ln, Austin, TX 78729",Austin,"Angela Honey is my hero! Solved all my issues in no time! Was a big pleasure to deal with herI have been banking with chase well over 5 years and had been to this center for some help(with an appintment). I was told that Emily would be helping me out with the task. It's just insane how unwelcoming n ride she was. She was not even willing to hear us out and all she had to say was ""No I can't do it""  and ""No I won't do it"". I was just surprised to hear her say she wouldn't notarize a document because she doesn't want to, and my understanding was there are rules on how and what can be notarized and it's not upto the individuals discretion. We were able to get the same documents notarized at another chase location a week ago and at a wells Fargo on the same day.

Well if I have keep it simple, I walked in my pregnant wife and we weren't even offered a seat. The worst ever banker I had dealt with. I could give her a 0, if I could.Angela Honey is the best employee of this branch, give her a raise ASAP!Obviously no one cares about this branch or whatever it is. ATM’s have constant problems. Went in for help today and they had no answer as to why I could not withdraw money. Asked if I got a confirmation text. From an ATM? Never. Suggested I go to another branch to make a withdrawal. Unprofessional and could care less about solving the problem. Not sure why they are getting paid at that location.Place is basically an ATM now.
I had set up an appointment for today only to find out upon showing up that they're ""temporarily closed.""
The only heads up I was given was an email reminder yesterday that I have a meeting scheduled for today... apparently they didn't say it would be a meeting with a sign that says ""sorry temporarily closed.""Closing my account after 10 plus years because of the horrible service at this branch. The ladies at their desks do everything they can to not help, they are lazy & rude.The FDIC AND THE BBB SHOULD DO A SURPRISE VISIT.Location is a glorified ATM.","Positives:
- Angela Honey is highly praised and seen as helpful and efficient
- Quick resolution of issues
- Some employees at other branches were helpful in notarizing documents

Room for improvement:
- One employee, Emily, was unwelcoming and unhelpful, refusing to assist with a task
- Lack of customer service, such as not offering a seat to a pregnant customer
- Constant problems with ATMs and lack of support or solutions from the branch
- Poor communication regarding temporary closures and lack of notification about changes

Miscellaneous:
- Some customers are considering closing their accounts due to poor service
- Request for surprise visits from regulatory agencies like the FDIC and BBB

58,Chase Bank,"7600 Burnet Rd, Austin, TX 78757",Austin,"Honestly i never write reviews, but I would give this place zero stars if I could. The amount of racism that one of the tellers shows for Hispanics is outrageous. She herself is foreign. Shania or Shanila whatever her name is gives the worst customer service. She has extremely rude to my father rolling her eyes and saying I don’t understand you and passing him on to another teller who was 100x nicer and more helpful. Rocie I believe her name was shout out to her for showing my father what good customer service looks like. I’ve never heard my father speak so ill of someone after his interaction with the first teller. I expected better from Chase and if it weren’t for Rocie we would have closed all of our accounts.I have been a Chase customer for thirteen years and I have never encountered such an unprofessional and depressing branch. Upon entering, most of the offices and cubicles are deserted. When I approach the bank tellers' counter, I get help from a lady who is all kindness, courtesy, and competence. While she is helping me her manager, Kat, goes out of her way to bully the teller right in front of me.

After Kat leaves the room and comes back in, I asked her to get me some water—because I was thirsty and to send the message that her job is serving the customers and not bullying her staff—and her employee jumps in and offers to get me the water while she's still helping me with my deposit. Kat has her employees so whipped and scared that they won't stand up to her, and I didn't see Kat lift one finger to do any work for the whole fifteen minutes I was in there.

This branch is foul with the stench of passive aggressive oppression and workplace persecution. I will not be back.Very rude and unprofessional bank staff. I came here at 4:30 on a Thursday, just needing to get a certified check made. The actual teller was nice and trying to help people out, but he seemed new and was referencing questions to an adjacent teller that was not taking customers. The senior teller was very rude, telling people the bank is closing in 30 min and that they could not complete transactions. I continued to wait and got to the teller who didn't know how to create a certified check (not his fault, he was just new), and when he got the senior teller over, I was told my transaction could not be completed by them and I had to use an ATM or leave. I have never had a problem with any bank service in the past, but left this branch feeling very frustrated and like my time was wasted. I would have even appreciated a more professional ask from the senior teller instead of just waving me off and telling me to leave or use the ATM. I strongly recommend not visiting this branch especially if you are coming within an hour of them closing.Very rude staff, Shanila the teller who handled my transaction literally had a smug attitude and laughed at me because I was unaware an easier way to make a transfer. It’s moments like this that I wonder why I deal with Chase Bank.I had to drive to a whole other location just to do a cash advance which i’ve done a million times. The other location had no issues doing the advance. The teller acted like he had no idea what he was doing. This isn’t the first time i’ve had issues with tellers at this specific location unlike every other chase bank i’ve been to. The tellers clearly need more training and there only being one teller every single time i’ve gone in is very frustrating.Chase service was always poor and now it's somehow even worse... hardly cam get anyone on the phone, the system always disconnects after spending countless minutes navigating the automated system. Hours of operation are pflegmatic and erratic.. we're exploring to move to another bank...Been with Chase Bank for over a decade, before that it was Washington Mutual Bank. My experience with Chase Bank has always been great. They are professional and honest.Sometimes there's a line, but the tellers are always very friendly and they get through clients as quickly as possible without rushing through the transactions. They're always accurate and careful.Waited in line for about 10 minutes only to be told I’d have to wait in another line for 10 minutes.It’s very convenient especially when you have a drive-through it makes your job a lot easier you don’t have to go find a parking space and running to and from the bank thank you for still having this area openAfter some genius ran into the second ATM they had it removed instead of fixed - disappointedIt’s impossible to call and reach anyonePERMANENTLY CLOSED","Positives:
- One teller (Rocie) provided good customer service and was helpful
- Kindness, courtesy, and competence of one bank teller
- Professional and honest service from Chase Bank
- Friendly and efficient tellers who are accurate and careful
- Convenient drive-through for easier banking

Room for Improvement:
- Racism displayed by one teller towards Hispanics
- Unprofessional behavior of managers, including bullying and mistreating staff
- New teller lacking knowledge and needing assistance
- Senior teller being rude and unhelpful to customers near closing time
- Rude and unprofessional attitude of one teller towards customers
- Lack of training for tellers at the specific branch
- Poor phone system and difficulty reaching someone

59,Chase Bank,"1811 S Congress Ave, Austin, TX 78704",Austin,"Ricky was so preoccupied in our first meeting that he didn't note when our follow up was. Then called us to find out when the second meeting was (the one he ""scheduled"") . Fifteen minutes before that meeting, we got a call from the bank stating Ricky wasn't there today and if we wanted to reschedule the next week. Mind you, the first meeting was rescheduled as well. We let them know that we felt it was not being handled professionally and we would look elsewhere. A canned ""I'm sorry"" was all that was offered. Take your time and money elsewhere.My experience was pleasant. The lady at the counter even wrote a number to call just in case the deposit was not available. She was great and professional. Thanks ChaseEvery single time I come here, they are very short staffed, and I can never get anything done, unless a basic deposit. And they have a revolving door of desk bankers, so it's hard to find someone to help consistently.My husband has been with Chase for over a decade. I have been with Velocity credit union and trying to get his to switch. We wanted to open a teen account for our son.

When we walked in there was no one in the lobby or a sign in sheet. We asked a guy sitting in a cubicle if he could help us. He told us someone else would-never greeted us, not rude but we knew we inconvenienced him.

The gentleman with the tablet who is in charge of greeting and organizing members greeted us and got the info of what we needed.

Unfortunately, they were booked for the day so we were unable to open an account for our teen. He sent us to the counter with a teller. We asked if we could have a brochure or info regarding the kid banking program designed to help kids learn about money. She was unable to print anything or offer a brochure.

We left with no new account and a distaste for the entire Chase banking establishment. Besides the guy with the tablet, the rest of the employees seem useless.

The good news is that now my husband is willing to stop banking with Chase.

I wonder how much their lack of customer service skills costs them everyday?It was pleasant working with Caroline in helping me get my account squared away swiftly!I needed to change my last name and had the most pleasant experience at this branch! The process was seamless, and I was in and out within 10 minutes. Will definitely return to this branch if I have any other in-person needs!The last day of the drive up banking at this location will be January 31, 2023. The branch will still offer services inside. 1811 S. Congress Ave. Austin,Texas 78704The experience of working with Valerie at the Chase Bank on S Congress has been nothing but great.

- The lady at the counter provided great service and even gave a number for follow-up
- Caroline provided swift and pleasant assistance in resolving account issues
- Valerie at the S Congress branch is consistently helpful, responsive, and kind
- Overall, the bank employees are pleasant and helpful

Room for Improvement:
- Ricky missed scheduled meetings and was unable to handle the situation professionally

- Lack of customer service skills from some employees, leaving a negative impression
- Phone calls are not answered promptly or at all
- ATMs around town are frequently broken

- Monthly fees for ""free"" checking accounts are perceived as unfair

Miscellaneous:
- The branch on S Congress will no longer offer drive-up banking starting from January 31, 2023

They rarely answer phone here, but no chase branch doesMichelle, the teller at the counter, was very kind and patient. Replaced a couple of debit cards after my wallet had been compromised. She was very thorough and patient and I really appreciate that.Kamal has been an incredible help getting my personal and business accounts set up. I am so thankful to have had him in my corner to advise me and help push admin through that would have otherwise been time consuming and complicated. Thanks again Kamal!Refused to take 2 minutes out of their day to notarize a document for my elderly grandfather because HE wasn't an account holder despite the fact that I WAS a Chase account holder.

Very rude and absolutely unnecessary.Worse bank to ever work with made me wait for a check I’ve already gotten paid for and I will be canceling any and all work being done with them immediately!!!!!!I don't understand all the criticism of a satellite branch; this is obviously not a full service location. The location clearly precludes any kind of drive-through. There are never any lines, and the staff are friendly.
p.s., I get rolls of quarters there all the time. That was a weird complaint.Horrible service and terrible bank overall. Chase is the most difficult when trying to do estate and trust planning. Do not use them, they are the ONLY bank that won't retitle an account for a trust.I tried calling and getting ahold of someone all day today (Monday) . No luck . I also tried Friday and Saturday . No luck . These employees do not like there job and will not go out there way to help.. they should shut this place down or replace all the employees . . .Worst banking experience ever.

Great experience, will be back if I need to go by a physical bank again.They have a phone listed but no one picks up the phone the lady at the money counter says they do there best LOL I guess they pay them lousy if they can't even answer the phone.

Thank you!This review is strictly for the drive thru from the hours of 10am-4pm.  Every week I have to make a cash withdrawal for a very specific amount of money.  Don't worry it's for a totally legal transaction.  But I can't use the drive thru ATM because i need it exact down to the $1 bill.  So I use the drive thru area with the suction tubes and I get to pretend for just a minute that it's 1992 again.  Every time I pull up there's usually an open lane and the tubes are always pre-loaded with working pens and withdrawal slips.  The staff is always very helpful and nice as I try to figure out how many 20s 10s and 1s i might need on any particular day as math isn't my strong suit.  The serotonin kick I get when that tube comes flying back to me filled with an envelope full of cash is unmatched.  Highly recommend this bank, and don't forget to take advantage of the direct deposit reward when opening a checking account.The employees in the branch cannot do anything at all and always have to call in to corporate. I had to request new credit cards 5 times and they never came. Every single time it's the same old excuse I went in to fix the previous 4 meetings. Very poor customer service.Nice bank. Friendly staff and they are pretty fast.Been associated with it here in Austin the past 37 years, when it was called Texas Commerce Bank, well before being incorporated into Chase. We have no issues and have enjoyed our working relationship all these years.Leticia Ibarra has been great to work with as our business banker. She goes above and beyond. Nothing but good things to say about this Chase branch.The morning staff at the drive through are great! They’re always super friendly and I always feel welcome!Great employee's that are very helpful and caring.The broken sign outside flashes and glitches. Makes it look like the terminator is about to teleport there.Be careful not to leave your car unlock. There is not cameras to help you out.Not enough staff to serve their customers.","Positives:
- The tellers are friendly and efficient.
- The staff at the drive-thru are great, friendly, and welcoming.
- Angela took care of concerns promptly and professionally.
- The drive-thru area with suction tubes is helpful and always stocked with pens and withdrawal slips.
- The staff is helpful, caring, and goes above and beyond.
- The bank has been enjoyed working with for many years.
- Leticia Ibarra, the business banker, is great to work with.

Room for improvement:
- The ATM frequently runs out of cash by mid-week, and the issue has persisted for two years.
- The bank's phone is not answered and there is a lack of responsiveness.
- The employees in the branch often have to call in to corporate for assistance.
- Requesting new credit cards multiple times without receiving them is a poor customer service experience.
- There is a lack of staff to serve customers.

Miscellaneous:
- A broken sign outside the bank creates a glitching effect, which may be misleading.
- There are no cameras in the parking lot to assist with security.
- Taking advantage of the direct deposit reward when opening a checking account is recommended."
62,Chase Bank,"3317 Northland Dr, Austin, TX 78731",Austin,"Best branch I have found in Austin so far. I usually keep good stuff a secret here, but they have attended me w good cust svc the few times i have gone in. Most other branches neglect their patrons here, making them wait a long time. They don't answer phone, but no chase branch doesWonderful customer service, energy, and help from Orlando! I walked in after having my purse and ID stolen the weekend prior needing a large sum of cash today, and Orlando went through great lengths to contact people and find me another Chase that would be able to fulfill my withdrawal through the inside ATM. A few branches were having repairs or problems with theirs, so him specifying and finding one that worked specifically helped majorly. Thanks again Orlando! :)Worse bank to ever work with made me wait for a check I’ve already gotten paid for and I will be canceling any and all work being done with them immediately!!!!!!","Positives:
- Good customer service
- Attentive and helpful staff
- Prompt service
- Willingness to go the extra mile

63,Chase Bank,"221 W 6th St, Austin, TX 78701",Austin,"Had a terrible experience here- I scheduled an appointment with suzy rivas, after she told me over the phone that she could assist with a beneficiary distribution. When I met with her in person she hadnt reviewed any of the documents I emailed her (documents she requested!) and she acted very short with me as if i was wasting her time. Then she refused to help me with the beneficiary distribution claiming that she was too busy and had to help another client! Ive never encountered another banker who had so many excuses and so little solutions. Dont bother with this branchIf your a small business owner do not open a bank account with this institution. Chris the bank manger and Shane who opened our account vouched to subscribe to a merchant service. We utilized this service and now our funds on hold for 120 days with no solutions.  The amount of the two transactions were 9k, with no solutions or options we are left with I am sorry's and no support from JPMorgan.

If would recommend to find a different bank! There is absolutely no reason why Chase has chosen to withhold our funds. JP Morgan does not hold its subsidiary's to the same standards.

As a small business owner who strives to run a legit business license and insured this is unacceptable.

Please keep in mind the branch Manager and Shane both opened our account!Save your self the trouble and take your business to a local bank or credit union!!!Great, human, authentic service. I had the biggest pain in the butt request for my banking needs and Heather H. from Chase made it happen without even flinching. It was a thoroughly enjoyable experience too. I feel like my needs as a small business owner were taken care of and I’m in a better position to have a successful financial 2023. Thank you very much to Heather for making it happen.Did away with ALL outdoor atms. Just screw anyone who doesn't work on your schedule huh? I can't wait to be done with this bank as a whole. Used to be great. Total trash now that doesn't care about its customers at all.Suzie at this location was rude from the moment we met. Acted like I was an immediate inconvenience to her and was altogether unhelpful.Went to this Chase branch to get a cashier's check, and Emerald was very helpful and pleasant to interact with. I appreciated the quick and friendly service! All the other staff were very friendly as well.Worse bank to ever work with made me wait for a check I’ve already gotten paid for and I will be canceling any and all work being done with them immediately!!!!!!Was greeted very warmly by all staff and received amazing help from Robin, would highly recommend for anyone looking to open an account.Another chase with no ATMs!Can't get in to use the ATM past closing$12 a month for my checking account? How about NO!","Positives:
- Heather H. provided great, human, authentic service and efficiently handled a difficult request.
- Emerald at the branch was helpful and provided quick and friendly service.
- Robin greeted the customer warmly and provided excellent assistance.
- All the other staff members were friendly.

Room for Improvement:
- Suzy Rivas did not review documents as requested and was short and unhelpful during the appointment.
- Chris the bank manager and Shane promised a merchant service but did not provide any solutions when funds were put on hold.
- Chase has chosen to withhold funds without providing explanations or options.
- The bank does not have outdoor ATMs, inconveniencing customers.
- Suzie at the branch was rude and unhelpful.

Miscellaneous:
- The customer recommends finding a different bank.
- There is a monthly fee of $12 for checking accounts, which the customer finds unacceptable.

64,Chase Bank,"3267 Bee Caves Rd, Austin, TX 78746",Austin,"Went in to downgrade one our credit cards.  The banker Michael told us that we could not downgrade but had to open a new card and then close our old card.  Seemed strange because this was something that Chase credit cards were known for, but he insisted that it could not be done and may have been a past feature.  He cited his experienced colleagues who told him that it could not be done.  So we begrudgingly applied for a new card. Then later that day, found out we could indeed downgrade the card.  Unfortunately, we could not cancel the application.  Michael was at least apologetic.  He got his manager George involved who despite telling us he was sorry, his tone suggested otherwise.  It didn't help that he made confusing statements.  He said that this process wouldn't hurt our credit score that bad, but he wasn't a credit report expert so he wouldn't know and then he made a suggestion regarding the credit cards, but then followed with that he wasn't an expert in credit cards.  That was obviously not helpful.  Needless to say, we are now stuck with a hit to the credit score thanks to them.  Will look at using the branch down the street near Dimensional. Maybe they'll have professionals who know their craft better and have better interpersonal skills.I’m no fan of going to the bank and occasionally feel a bit wary of advice given at banks.  Today I worked with Amy Jantho and even with our phone conversations I felt good about her.  Meeting and discussion matters with her confirmed she is great.  Kind, patient and really goes the extra mile to help customers.  I definitely recommend her and her trustworthy advice.

I need to update this.  I've called repeatedly here and can not get a person to pick up!  Just like any big bank or corporation we are only important to the extent profit can be gained from us and really not even then.  Screw Chase!Terrible service. Put a hold for a DAYS on a check from a CHASE check to our chase account! Jeez.Friendly staff, no high pressure from the bankers","Positives:
- Amy Jantho is described as kind, patient, and goes the extra mile to help customers.
- Friendly staff and no high-pressure tactics from the bankers.

Room for improvement:
- Inconsistent information and confusion provided by the banker Michael and his manager George.
- Lack of knowledge or communication about certain bank features or processes.
- Difficulty in reaching a person over the phone and perceived lack of importance given to customers.

Miscellaneous:
- The customer expressing a preference to try a different branch that may have more knowledgeable and skilled professionals.
- Negative sentiment towards Chase bank and frustration with their service."
65,Chase Bank,"6200 Bee Caves Rd, Austin, TX 78746",Austin,"If you're a recipient of a chase check. Don't bother taking it here.  They over scrutinized my name , won't cash it because my name is Michael and not Mike was their excuse.  I can take it to any other chase and usually no problem whatsoever but you guys get poor grade since you are treating your bank customers this way.  Basically this check is worthless at this location what you guys are telling meI have experienced the worst customer service in my life in this bank. This bank branch is the worst with hidden fees, because the account arrangements that you make with branch representatives will not be honored for long. I have been a customer for years, and each time the same thing happens and I regret it.
The branch manager even had the audacity to argue with me when I told him to close my account.

If I could give lower than one star, I would.Excellent customer service. The people were very friendly and knowledgeable. I will continue to come to this branch.I had superb service at this branch, shout out to Elsa Rios for helping me through my financial needs!$12 a month for my checking account? Planet fitness only charges $10 a month and I actually get something for that. These fees should be criminal and I will be contacting a consumer protections advocate.","Positives:
- Friendly and knowledgeable staff
- Excellent customer service
- Specific mention of helpful employee (Elsa Rios)
- Positive experience with financial needs

- Over-scrutinization and refusal to cash a check due to a slight difference in the recipient's name

66,Chase Bank,"1011 E 5th St. Ste 100, Austin, TX 78702",Austin,"I have had some issues with the apartment building I am living in withdrawing money from a closed/ wrong account and then charging me for late and NSF fees. I went in to this specific Chase (east 5th street) and Associate Banker, Sydnee Chenault sat with me as we went through my statements and helped me create a plan to go back to my building. She was extremely helpful, VERY patient and knowledgeable. I have been back to the bank since and she is always super friendly and always goes above and beyond.Today I stoped by to do an international wire transfer, the associate banker Sydnee Chenault filled out the application with the wire instruction I provided, however, I spotted an issue and she didn't fill out application correctly. While she becomes very defensive, people make mistakes I understand, but apparently she does't have much experience because the wire transfer involves an intermediate bank, which is more complicated. She didn't feel sorry and kept saying that it's the customer's liability to make sure the form is filled out correctly. however, filling out the form is not my job and I provided a detailed instruction. As an experienced banker should be able to read it. What make it worse is, her supervisor Jason Orr, the private client banker, came out to help and confirmed the firm wasn't filled out correctly, however, Jason didn't apology for the staff and stepped in to fix the mistake, and Sydnee refused to assist me because I wasn't happy. Nowadays people can refuse to do their job and waste the customer's time without apologizing and keeping blaming. This branch can only handle easy matter but not complex matters!Canadian citizen transitioning to United States. Tried to open bank account and due to bank policy was unable to do so. Will not be back and unfortunately will not be recommending Chase to anyone in similar circumstances. Disappointed.The team here has always been nice and courteous, this is not a review of Chase as a service, just the nice location, comfy atmosphere and really friendly service I have gotten here.

They've also gone out of their way to make time for me, even when I forgot to book an AppointmentShowed up for a 1:30 appointment with Jason and waited 20 minutes in the lobby without any updates regarding when we would start even after explicitly asking for one. Ended up leaving because I don't have an hour to waste . Awful customer service, don't come here if you value your time.Arrived at 440 and they were closed on Monday February six. I had no debit card because someone committed fraud and they were sending me another one.Terrible bank, terrible service. Waiting until I was in branch at my appointment to tell me that my lease, a signed legal document, does not count as ‘proof of address’ avoid at all costs if you value your time.Dropped by on a Saturday during business hours and no one was there.  Called the phone number listed online and there is no option to talk to a real person.So the bank “opens” from 9-2pm on Saturdays but if you go, there is nobody! I went at 10am and they asked me to come back at 1pm so there could be somebody to help! This is just for a regular “opening a bank account” service! Do not go!!$12 a month for my checking account. WHY DON'T YOU TAKE MY BLOOD TOO YOU VAMPIRES!!When you need an appointment for something as simple as a credit card application..ATM is glitchy and spazzes out 👎 …","Positives:

67,Chase Bank,"2119 E 7th St, Austin, TX 78702",Austin,"Awesome team and customer service. Esp after just going through my account being compromised and identity theft - they handled it big time. Angel went above and beyond!  Thank you!By far the worst Chase branch in Austin. If I have a problem making a deposit or dealing with an issue, it's due to this branch. High turnover and a general lack of knowledge in explaining things is a big problem. My advice is to drive to any other branch if you need to go to a Chase branch.Really appreciated the Branch Manager VP
George Hernandez. I showed up late with an issue I thought could be handled quickly. It needed more time and he stayed after hours to help me. He was such a blessing and really helped me with my issue, amazingly and willingly.I love that they have two ATMs in the drive-thru and not one of them work and And here's a crazy suggestion if your lobby is closed you should lock the door. People might want to walk in and use a ATM that works? And here's another crazier suggestion as a bank maybe have a ATM that actually worksGood, reliable, safe and informative bank experience.All of the staff was super friendly and helpfulThis bank needs to fix the left side atm outside. I went yesterday to deposit some cash and it gave me an error message. Now my money isn’t available until who knows when. Mind you this is the 3RD Time that this has happened on the SAME machine. Chase needs to send a technician and fix this ASAP! Or the least you could do is block the way so its not accessible. The personnel there is completely ignorant and careless. Not to mention they also shorted me $80 about 6 months ago when i cashed my check… hope you enjoyed my money adam 👎🏽 i would give 0 stars if i could.Always solid service.

The business lane is always efficient. They've been great to work with when other Chase branches have given me trouble with depositing checks from customers that weren't written perfectly. Obviously it's hard for me to make sure every customer writes a check just right.

They appear to usually, if not always, have Spanish speaking clerks.This is the slowest branch l have the displeasure of going to. I hate having to go here because it takes forever for even the simplest of transactions.The tellers are very well informed and always give their best attention to detailThis branch does not answer phones even after hours of calling. And also does not follow through on promises on returning money.Not happy at all with my experience at these banks.Chase it’s my Banco","Positives:

68,Chase Bank,"1920 E Riverside Dr Bldg C, Austin, TX 78741",Austin,"Ok Chase Bank if you are going to close early before posted closing time then notify the call center or hang a sign up on the door. Don’t advertise online and on the front door that you close at 5pm and I arrive 10 minutes before the branch closes and it’s already shut down and empty. So I try again the next day and come 40 minutes before you close and the branch is once again closed early. And once again no signs 🪧 stating that you had to close early due to a emergency. I call the 800 customer service and she says there are notes that the Riverside Dr branch would be closed. Chase bank #dobetter #beopenwhenyousayyouwillbeopenBranch is in a prefect location on riverside. Plenty of parking and located just next to east riverside drive.

Their ATMs are on a different level than any other banks and their staff is always happy to help.Really annoyed that I came here on a Saturday to purchase a cashier's check, which I mentioned was for my car purchase the following Monday. They gave me no heads up that it would take 2 business days to validate this cashier's check, and that it might not be ready in time. So I canceled all my meetings and drove to San Antonio today just to find out the check needs another day of processing, just to have to come back tomorrow. Would've appreciated a warning!Unfortunately, it was a bad experience for me, I came to open a new account, and they didn't accept the docs that I have with me, even though I have an account with them... the employee didn't take time to check on their system. Apparently, he needs more training,  customer service wasn't good.Very clean, modern bank with great service. At the date/time of my visit, there was no wait time.Terrible the inexperienced employee and manager did not know how to handle an echeck made to petty cash . Simply pathetic customer service . Most branches especially the Killeen/Harker Heights  branch is amazing. Jennifer was awful rude and judging how I looked when I came in . This is unacceptable my company uses this bank in 6 states this experience may be changing that .I went to Lamar branch was treated polite respectful and was out with my checks cashed in 5 minutes! This branch needs to be restaffedThis branch is amazing! I worked with Jenn, absolute rock star! She helped me address all my issues and answered all my questions. I feel confident and look forward to returning to this location for my banking needs!Brand new branch with good parking, a drive through ATM, and several interior ATMs. I visited the lobby at 10:30AM on a Wednesday and the line moved quickly even with only 1 of the 2 teller windows open. Christina was friendly, polite, and very helpful!

This is my new go-to Chase branch. Despite the (current) lack of a multi lane drive through, the combination of ample parking space and fast interior service are worth the quick run inside.This place was amazing.  Came in to withdrawl some cash after my card had fraud.  They set me up with Apple Pay with my new card (which I didn’t know was possible), and were extremely kind.  Blessed people.  Best Chase or any bank I’ve ever been to.Chase customer service is the absolute worst and I’ve them for less than a month. Trying to get anyone to actually help you fix the issue is like pulling teeth. Currently looking for another bank. (This is for the call center customer service not the branch)This place lost my retirement check that I was planning in putting into my IRS. Go to another branch campus if you don’t want to deal with incompetency.Can’t speak with someone over the phone in this location, been calling for 2 days now and the answering machine keeps saying their bankers are busy assisting other clients.
BS.The bank’s team is so small you can’t do anything you couldn’t at an ATM with out an appointment days in advance.GoodGood serviceATM never workThe customer service is very bad, I actually do not recommend it, these types of employees do not want to work, I had to deposit cash, I generally use the ATMs and it turns out that the 4 ATMs inside the bank did not work and the bankers looked at me and did not even greet me out of courtesy. I had to leave the place and deposit at the ATM outside. I don't know what's going on with this bank at this address, either they always close early, or the ATMs always don't work and when you need the service they don't serve you, there is always something negative about this place. I actually don't recommend this bank, it would be better if they closed it.I just came to the bank to withdraw money and I asked a worker if I could use the bathroom, hello he gave me the key to the bathroom very quickly in English hello I asked again in Spanish the key was repeated to me again in English then i tried to enter the key it didn't open the bathroom door so i left with my stomach sore since i am a person who suffers a lot from stomach disease thank you chase for these people who have no empathy asia the others if you are in a bad way quit and search a job to your liking that is your job to treat people wellExcellent customer service","Positives:

69,Chase Bank,"701 E Stassney Ln Bldg J, Austin, TX 78745",Austin,"BE AWARE!

I went about two weeks ago to cash in a check. After I came out and stopped in a pawnshop at Congress.  Someone busted two windows of my car and only checked the console where I placed the money.  Luckily I hided it well enough they couldn’t find it… I suspect there’s is a connection between the people inside the bank and the thieves.

Don’t ever go to this location…

PS: for some strange reason the lady teller didn’t give me a receipt…!I went to get a new savings account. I set up a meeting with Gisel Negrete. Let me say she is fabulous. She answered all my questions and made the process super fun & easy. She has amazing customer service and was very patient with my children & I.Don’t waste your time going to this Chase Bank. Their tellers, bank manager, and even security are rude. They temporarily closed the bank lobby the day before the Holiday which lead to a long line in the drive through/atms. One of their atms outside does not even work. Just don’t waste your time folks!Entrance personnel welcoming. Female teller, not the new employee but the other one,  was rude, impatient and obviously didn't want to be there. I only went there because my regular one on Slaugter, closed early due to A/C issues.The 2nd ATM never works! And today there’s a light that says ATM green light but the whole ATM is gone. This location has been like this for a while!! Get it together!The ATMs at this branch NEVER work, one or both is broken all the time, and they leave the green light on when it’s broken so people line up and wait just to see it doesn’t work. Also, this ATM stole 341$ cash deposit from me ( said deposit complete but the money never showed up in my account) and this caused a whole chain of transfers, ODPs, etc. Do not deposit cash here! I went to the Congress location and they helped me and were super kind.This location sucks. Seem like everyone is always in a bad mood. You can just feel the negative energy as soon as you can all in. I went there not long ago. And was told all the wrong information regarding a 1300$ transaction…So I went to the branch on slaughter Lane. And they fixed the problem for me, no problem. Do not waste your time coming to this location. The heavyset lady with black rim glasses is especially rude and unprofessional.How is it possible that this bank is getting worse not only atms are always having issues, but to get inside being in line for an hour and having full staff!? I will also be calling to complaints. I will have to start driving a little further just to get better service on slaughterI have had  a  very bad experience with Chase Bank in itself. I went the one on stassney lane at the end of July and  was going to deposit 560.00 on my granddaughter's account. When I went up to the teller and told her I wanted to deposit the cash money she told me I needed to do it in a check. So right there and then wrote the check for 560.00 dollars. At the beginning of August I noticed my account showed a withdrawal of 1250.00 dollars with a check that was copied and changed the amount and the check number about 1000 numbers which didn't make any sense that I would use 1000 checks in 2  weeks when I don't really use check for the exception of that day. It is going on 6 months and chase has not been able to return my money even though the check  is very noticeable that it was altered. I have sent copies of the original check and the altered check with shows the difference between the original check and the altered check. The sad thing about it is that the 1250.00 never left the chase bank because they closed the account and yet they have not return my money. So here I am 6 months later 1250.00 short on my IBC account.friendly stuffs.... thks for good servicesConvenient location. Patient staff.This is the worst Chase branch that I have ever visited.  Nobody come up and help and totally waste my time here.Slowest Chase Branch in Austin, even when there aren't many customers in line it takes forever to get through its faster to drive to another branch further away than to wait in line here$12 a month fee on my checking account? Way to chase me to a credit union.They are running business like a local flea market violating hours of operation anytime they wantawful service, disconnected phone, inept in all businessThis comment. I write it for Mrs. Doris I could give you zero stars but I don't have that option seriously, one comes kindly to ask for information and the receptionist Doris with a bad attitude, it's your fault that she is not happy with her job if you go to the bank It's because customer service couldn't help us over the phone or we didn't get the right answer. You're not going to ask them for money and I know we shouldn't say this, but if you didn't keep the money in the banks, they wouldn't have a job, basically, we would give them a job. We paid seriously that receptionist Doris needs training on how to treat people better because it is not the first time she has a bad attitude and now we had to go to another Chase bank so they could give us information because unfortunately with Doris's attitude we could not do nothing but have a bad day
I hope if customer service can read my message and make and improve, thank you for your attentionThey always treat you with kindness and respect.Mrs. Dalia Nañez is very good at her job, thank you Chase for having a good worker.Of two ATMs, only one works, there is always a line to use them","Positives:

Staff displayed a lack of knowledge and were downright lazy with both business related issues we had. The business banker couldn’t even be bothered to get up from his desk to speak with us. Other Chase branches have always been accommodating and polite. This branch was anything but.I cannot express enough how upset I am. Been on the drive through line for for 25 mins, getting no where. I cannot believe I cannot have access to my own money by depositing/cashing a check freaking made to my name because I don’t have exactly the same amount of funds as the check! Now I have to wait until the check is cleared. Absolutely ridiculous and waste of time. Will definitely be switching banks!We have never been to a bank before that had 1 customer and 5+ employees where we had to wait a ridiculous amount of time and ultimately made the decision to leave without being helped. Hoping the Chase Bank in Lakeway has better service. Thank goodness for online banking because nobody has time for this. If it wasn't for having to make a high dollar wire transaction there is no way we would ever have stepped foot into this bank.I walked into the Chase bank with my family on 3/30/2022 at 2:13 pm.  A gentleman was ahead of me and I overheard he was going to make a deposit in his savings.  The banker made a mistake and deposited his funds into one of his other accounts.  This literally took 20 minutes to figure out.  I waited my turn and walked up after this transaction was complete and asked to wire funds for closing on a house she said ""someone will be right with you."" 10 minutes went by and nothing.  2 bankers were in their cubicles just chatting away about their personal lives. Another banker came in and stood next to the banker who made a mistake with the deposit and was acting busy but didn't have a customer.  This place has bankers who stand around not doing anything and they are slow as molasses.I was waiting to transfer my business account to personal and they couldn't do it. I got very disappointed!!Every month it's $12 a month for the privilege of having a checking account? It doesn't cost you $12 a month to steal my money. I'm going to switch to an internet bank if this does not end soon.Horrible customer service. I honestly don't know how this branch remains open.","Positives:
- Other Chase branches have always been accommodating and polite

Room for improvement:
- Staff displayed a lack of knowledge and were lazy with business-related issues
- Business banker did not leave his desk to assist
- Long wait times for drive-through service
- Restrictions on depositing/cashing a check with slightly different funds
- Long wait times and lack of assistance at the bank branch
- Bankers chatting about personal lives instead of attending to customers
- Inability to transfer a business account to personal
- Monthly fee for checking account deemed too high

Miscellaneous:
- Horrible customer service at the branch"
71,Chase Bank,"140 W Slaughter Ln, Austin, TX 78748",Austin,"These are without a doubt the most friendly, professional, and amazing people you would want to do business with as a business owner. I have come here with a variety of questions, requests, and needs over the last year and John and Justin have reminded me exactly what it should be like working with a bank to grow your business. It’s about relationships at the end of the day, and that’s what will keep me coming back to Chase year over year. These are two amazing individuals who really care about you as a customer, and you can feel that. Thank you so much!Overall, I'm satisfied with Chase as a bank. This location has really nice staff and helpful management. But their drive-up ATM's are awful. And that's mainly what I use this branch for. Either they're not working, or they can't read my check, or on one occasion, the machine ate my checks and didn't return them to me, which prompted me to have to call the national customer service number to get it resolved. I get that the drive-up ATM's are operated by another vendor, but if Chase is going to use them, they need to keep them in better working order.Always a great experience at Chase.

I have my personal and business checking here. The tellers are exceptionally friendly and prompt. The staff has always been good through the and I'm very thankful to be working with such a great bank!This is the single worst bank I have ever been to. They are not capable of keeping more than one of the three ATMs working so on the weekend there are 10 cars wrapped around the building like a drive through. This bank probably serves roughly 200,000 people in south austin and is a stain on the chase brand.Justin Gomez is a true professional, and made my experience signing up for a credit card seamless. In general this Chase branch is very friendly and professional, thanks yall!I own a car wash and do all of my small business banking here. I think the team is awesome. So friendly and they always take care of me.My teller was so friendly and engaged in small talk while also demonstrated efficiency during my transaction to order checkbooks. I so wish I could remember her name! Also, a man named John came out and gave my 1-year-old a coloring book. Great customer service experience this morning at this Chase branch! *edited to add that the security guard greeted and wished us goodbye with a friendly smile!Convenient bank location. ATMs inside and teller area is spaciousThey charge a fee for cashing their own checks. This is RIDICULOUS! My daughter earns money from the state for college courses she takes as a minor, and Chase takes that money away from her simply to convert it from paper to to cash. Way to nickel and dime your community, Chase. Horrible business practices.Rude and unhelpful. Tried to open a business account, they said we’d have to wait TWO weeks to even be seen by somebody. Guy claimed no bank would be able to help us same day or open bank account same day. Went across the street to both Wells Fargo and UFCU. Both helped us and seated us, we walked out with a business checking account at UFCU with lower fees 30 min later.Better than the Stassney location! Tried doing an IRA transfer and was told by customer service I needed a specific form filled out and notarized. Went in the branch told them specifically what I needed and was basically ignored. The Hispanic man had me sit there for an hour while getting someone on the phone. I’m 38 weeks pregnant and this was extremely inconsiderate. I walked out with the forms I could have simply printed elsewhere without the hassle.Use to be able to get cash from the atm at the front door after hours. Now it’s only during business hours. Kinda defeats the purpose of having an atm by the front doors.  Offer other bills at the drive thru atm.Generally one of the worst chase branches I've ever been to. I've been with Chase for 10 years and they've gotten progressively worse. Might be time for a switch.Have been a Chase Bank Customer for many years they are very professional and have been able to help us in our Banking needs for along time, very friendly staff and secure environment, highly recommendedThis branch has too many empty cubicles and only has 1 person attending the front desk. To open an account, you have to wait close to a month for any problem with account services.This branch was extremely helpful, friendly, and prompt when I showed up a few minutes before closing for notarization. In particular, Tim Jensen, was very kind and helpful.Why in the whole building there is only one person that can possibly help the customer?
No other option was offered, but just to come back another time when this one person is available. Pretty sad customer serviceJustin is a good men!
He help me with wireless transfer.
Thank you.$12 monthly fee for a checking account? You make me sick. Change the name to Cheat Bank.Fast and easy transaction!!
Pleasant staff 👍 …Maria was so helpful with the issue we had!!! Love this location.DO NOT deposit any checks with them. And good luck calling them they just ignore the phone.went twice and still didnt get helpedI recommend this location
The staff, from the moment you enter, are super friendly and welcome you with a smile. If you don't speak Spanish, the receptionist or the bank agent will look for someone who speaks your language.

72,Chase Bank,"5407 N Interstate Hwy 35, Austin, TX 78723",Austin,"Fast and easy, plus it's safety there is a truper in the lobby. Very safe location during the day timeAbsolute worst experience in a bank to date. Worst customer service iv ever had, they had like 10 employees and only 2 of them were working the teller booth. Everyone else was just walking back and forth ignoring the line that was nearly out the door and just talking amongst themselves giggling. I stood in like for 20 min with Noone asking me why I was there. Will not be back to this location.Make an appointment or else you may not get taken care of. They never told me this. Found out the hard way.Waited for Chase to open this morning at 9AM. Manager came to the door at 8:58 with a paper sign saying this branch is temporarily closed. I guess they just found out? One more reason I am closing my accounts with Chase after being with them for 16 years.Came here at 8:00 p.m., only 1 drive through ATM, it was an over 30 minute wait.I've been coming to this location for at least 6-7 years. Plenty of parking and a drive thru, big lobby. I never have to wait. The area is pretty ghetto so that makes me hesitate to go inside, but I've never had an issue. There's always a police officer walking around to keep it safer.This Chase Bank location is temporarily closed. Wish they had updated Google Maps and such. Just a paper sign on the entrances while branding and such is still up.
There is an ATM, but the bank itself is closed. I took pictures to update Google, but I guess those don’t save to my camera roll.From the looks of all the other reviews, you can see why I gave one star. I go to deposit a check to Chase, which I have had an account now for over 4 years now. They say ""oh, you have to go cash it at a different bank, because it's a Wells Fargo check. So what your telling me is that a check that I received from an employer, doesn't work with this bank and that I ha e to go somewhere else?!?! Are you kidding me? Why does someone who has a bank account have to go to another bank? I mean, I guess I have to get a new bank....Went to open a business account and waited 30 minutes in the lobby after confirming my appointment only to be told that they wouldn’t have time for my appointment that I had scheduled in person a week ago. Complete waste of time, exceptionally unprofessional!!bad customer service not very helpful at all.It is very frustrating that every time you need to make any transaction, they ask for ID even when you bring the card and put the PIN number

Now I understand why it is one of the worst banks in the countryThe ATM machines outside are always breaking down and not working. I went inside and only one ATM is working. Why don't they get a new one instead of always repairing the old machines. Only at this location.Called ahead and was told that for the activity that I needed to do, I could just walk-in and didn’t need to schedule an appointment. After walking in, I waited near a half hour with friendly employees advising me they’d be right with me. However, at the end of the wait an employee advised me that they were too busy to work with me to resolve my issue. Disappointed I spent so much time here to get nothing resolved.Max just helped me get a hold off of my check so I can pay rent finally. Whew! Thumbs down for mobile banking unfortunately. Super great experience in the branch though!Teller at this branch (Mr. Cheedi) and manager (Veronica) were very helpful in getting good bills for my travel abroad. I appreciate their patience and time.Fantastic customer service. Thank you SujayaTook insanely long to withdraw cash and some of the worst customer experience in my life. However, it was just another typical transaction with Chase.This is actually the most understaffed and slowest Chase in North America. Makes more sense to drive across town and use another branch every time.Patricia was extremely kind and helpful in getting me information quickly.

I felt bad I did not get the teller name. Time is 7/24/2023, from 9:15 to 9:40. Teller is a guy.Timothy Jenkins was friendly and extremely helpful in our complicated situation. We are from Canada and work visas add complications when it comes to banking. Thanks again for your help! Clean branch, friendly people.Raul Suarez and Marjorie are very helpful and very good at making my bank experience with Chase wonderful! Raul is very kind person with great attitude always with me! Kudos for both!!!Customer service is seriously lacking except for the one banker who is amazing, super responsive but unfortunately, also too busy to be available when needed.  Not enough staff and the one ATM teller who works afternoons has the worst attitude towards her job, doesn't have enough knowledge and doesn't even want to try and find the answer to improve her knowledge to hopefully, help the next person that might have the same question the next time. It's sad to see the level of service degrade to such low levels.  And yes, they never answer the phones.  Branch manager - please help improve the customer experience!They tell you to make an appointment, but they literally NEVER answer the phone. I don't believe it even rings in the bank. I've called dozens of times across multiple days. To me, the point of making an appointment is so I won't have to make multiple trips into the bank in order to get help with one simple thing. But this is what happens EVERY time.Customer service is just not where it needs to be. I went to notarize some documents and it was as if they didn’t want to do it. It was like pulling teeth and the notary Alyssa Gil wasn’t knowledgeable at all.Worst bank ever got a credit card from Amazon through them took me 4 calls over 6 months been cancelled a month they are still tring to charge me fees.Does anyone work here other than the manager? 7 empty desks at 3PM on Monday.Horrible service, especially the bank manager... poor fellow is helpless.$12 a month for my checking account?

75,Chase Bank,"12713 Shops Pkwy Bldg R, Bee Cave, TX 78738",Austin,"I’ve had two poor experiences at this branch:

1) My wife and I originally set up a joint account 1.5 years ago.  It took two hours, we had to wait a long time before the appointment and then it took forever just to close one account and roll it into a new joint account.

2) Today I went in to do a simple 401K roll over into a self managed IRA.  I had the check in hand and the website said my options were to do it in person or mail it to New Jersey.  I figured it was better/safer to get it into the system by directly handing it off and getting confirmation.  I walked in at 11:10 on a Saturday.  The teller couldn’t do it and told me I could have an appointment with one of the other two people working at 12:00.  I accepted the appointment.  I left and came back at 11:50.  The teller told me the appointment was likely going to run another 15 minutes late.  The appointment went 30 minutes late and I wasn’t seen until 12:30.  The people the bank representative was working with seemed like they were just opening an account, but the representative was making all sorts of chit chat and taking forever.

Just focus on getting the transaction done so you can keep a schedule instead of trying to be the friendly neighborhood bank.  If you aren’t going to cross train your employees so anyone can help with a transaction (the 2 other people who were working and unable to help me) then keep a schedule tight so people aren’t waiting around.

I left Ally Bank for Chase to have the connivence of a local branch, but if I have to make an appointment, and you can’t even stay on time with your appointments, then you’re not convenient; and therefore, irrelevant.

Lastly, their branch manager keeps leaving me voicemails to talk about their Private Client service, which really means they want to find a way to make more in fees off of our money.  Stick to learning to walk before you try to run and get your service model squared away first.Branch doesnt have bankers available without waiting several days for an appointment. Your bank works to support the customers, its the only reason to build a branch vs an ATM. If you can't staff it close it and leave the ATM please.ATM wouldn't deposit checks. Spit back out after everything saying ""transaction denied"" No reason given.I may not be a customer of Chase Bank but I was very pleased and happy with the level of attention and excellent service provided by Nedda Hall, an Associate Banker, and Adrianne Wempe, the Branch Manager. Chase Bank may be a large, corporate bank but it has that small town connection with its community, particularly in Bee Cave.

It is great to do business with a bank that treats customers and non-customers like regular, real human beings. Nedda was happy to assist me promptly with my request while Adrianne made sure I was taken care of during my visit. Nedda and Adrianne are prime examples of connecting with customers and doing business with the community - the right way! Bee Cavers, I would recommend banking with Chase!This is a worst bank that i ever work with.
Im a bussiness owner and its been 10 years and i never have any problem with any banks but this Chase bank in Beecave.
I made a paycheck for my staff on March 16 and he deposited by mobile app. That check was already clear and show up in my bank statement's history on March 17. But that Chase bank (Beecave) still hold the check up to 13 days and no release that check for my staff to cash out with some non-sense reasons. They ask us to show up in person and prove that check from the bussiness owner. Thats crazy and rediculous! I cant believe it. My staff still have alot of things to pay and i have to drive all the way down to Beecave chase bank cause my area just only local bank. It doesnt make any senses and i still spend my time to talk to them but everything i got just a worst Chase Bank maneger.I can not recommend this Chase branch enough. The staff are all so friendly and helpful, special thanks to Maria!The branch was a bit busy. I did not have an appt. Approximately a 20 minute wait. John apologized for the delay and was extremely courteously and personable.  Appreciate his excellent service.  Thanks again.Just go 8 minutes down to the Chase in Lakeway. Better customer service and I’m able to always get my money out. Have been a customer for over 10 years and this branch is the worst I have dealt with.Expect long wait times more than an hour.. went to the bank toy. The banker was busy making conversation with the customer, rather than attending the queue. Good customer service for one poor service for the restThe telephone number provided leads you nowhere. I’m out of town and can’t get a hold of my Chase bank.The worst experience we have ever had at a bank.$12 a month for my checking account? How do you sleep at night? I've been a customer for over 12 years. This is despicable.","Positives:

76,Chase Bank,"2711 La Frontera Blvd #300, Round Rock, TX 78681",Austin,"One of the most non user friendly banks I’ve ever dealt with. There will never be an ATM that is working, and there will always be a line or long wait. The staff is nice enough but if you go to this location thinking it will be a quick transaction even to withdraw $20 from an ATM.. you are very wrong.Literally the worst banking experience of my life. If you bank with Chase, just avoid this location.
Chase itself is fine, but this location should be ashamed. They lie, lie, lie. I am still cleaning up and asking questions from an appointment to identify my first business account. What a terrible experience. I will never refer someone due to this. At all opportunities, I will deter someone from coming here.
Luckily, I am able to bank with a much better banker at a different location, but avoid this one at all costs. I cannot even describe all of the lies that were told to coerce me into opening a credit card here.
AVOID THIS LOCATION.I made an appointment to have my nephew open a student account. The website clearly states what it needs from an international student. We brought the documents and waited for some time in the lobby. And finally when our turn came, the rep insisted my nephew bring a third document like a utility bill in his name in order to open an account. She even said that she said the same to two other international students who came before us. The most frustrating thing was we went to another chase bank and opened the account with just the passport and I20, it took 20 min from start to finish. This branch does not know it's own requirements to open an international student account. I will not bank at this branch.Today I came in per usual to get my rent check and Anissa made me feel so important. She asked how to pronounce my name then followed with “but you like for me to call you Sherrie” and that really made my day. After having a long week this was so comforting to know that people care. I never have problems in there everyone always has smiles on their faces. Thank you ❤️ if you ever thought you weren’t making a difference , you are.Wasted time on waiting for nothing.
We want to open an new account and walked into the branch without appointment.
1. Branch assistant told us to wait for a few minutes to allow their manager to check their system.
2. After 10 minutes, branch assistant said if we can wait for another 6 minutes their manager will help us open the account.
3. Waited another 6 minutes , we saw the manager walked away.
4. Waited another 5 minutes, manager comes back and do nothing.
What’s wrong with you guys?This is the second time that I haven't received my direct deposit from my job , I would normally always get it on Wednesdays around 9:30pm , but I have yet to get it please fix these issues I haven't had this issue before I was always able to get it on time.Too busy. The teller that was working the drive thru was answering my questions with her back towards me. Lol not great customer service in my book.  And this is while the GPS says that it's less busier than usual.  I don't want to be there when it's even busier.I would not recommend doing much of anything at this Chase bank. My husband and I attempted on 3 sperate occasions to open accounts. More so because I've been a chase member for 15 years, but after multiple failed attempts due to system issues, I decided to close my accounts and head across the street to Frost, who by the way can print a card out immediately when opening your account.
I understand it was a system issue each time, but it was more or so the way it was handled. The GM after the 3rd attempt setting an appointment, coming in, and then told not working,  tried to get me to open an account on my phone and then add husband later, what's the point? I could have done this at home! We also had our appointment cancelled with no one taking any effort to immediately fix it. Bankers are never available to do anything either. After not being able to open an account it was time to close mine. Same thing, cancelled appointments, I attempted walking in as soon as they opened , but the banker available couldn't help me. I was schedule for an appointment for over a week later. Not so great customer service. Go to Frost across the street, can open an account fast and print out your cards then and there.Came by the bank in Round in Rock la Frontera today 1145 and talk to the teller to deposit cash. The account wasn’t mine,  yet I had the account number ( for my elderly mother who cannot come to bank to do it) to deposit. After asking several times what the reason is all I kept getting was policy and the law ( it’s not). I’m sure it’s a training issue but all I had to do is Google it to find the answer. I think just a simple understanding of why a policy is in place would help their employees be a little more customer service oriented.  ( the more you know the more you grow & then the more you can help your customers). For anyone reading this here, the reason you cannot deposit cash into someone else’s account at CHASE bank, which is not the same as every bank (not my bank which is why this was perplexing)  Apparently it’s easier to launder cash then it is a check or money order, which they WILL take.  So there you goSeveral times, the ATM doesn't work. I tried 3 times in this month on different days and twice the touch screen doesn't work in the ATM outside. Similar thing happened to the car before meTerrible customer service.  Never use the ATM.  Manager will look straight at you and go off to eat....everyone deserves to eat...but arrange for backup first!Elijah and the team were a wonderful help! I walked in at 4:50 pm and he did not hesitate to help me right away. My account had been locked and he fixed it right up! #blessed #chirinolyfestyleLooking at reviews for this location and not surprised - the one girl who appears to be a lead is rude and very impersonal. I had a small amount of cash to deposit and she made me wait to the side and had another staff member count the money while she assisted with drive through. Awful customer service and I left my contact information with the branch manager for a return call.I went to this branch and the teller was EXTREMELY PATIENCE and nice with my mom, very hard lady to please! Erick was polite and respectful, very appreciatedStaff seems very overwhelmed not able to be flexible under high pressure times. Not impressed with service or interactions at this specific location the last 3 visits in July + August.
The private client chases give extremely better service hands down.Most employees are very helpful and the bank has great tech and digital features. The bank is quick and very convenient.

My only concerns are the time it takes to have large checks deposited, perhaps look to a smaller local bank for depositing large checks.Showed up an hour before closing and the staff was not willing too help me too get set up with opening a new account. The guy helping me kept looking at the clock. And wasn't willing too help me open a new account. They just seemed lazy and not wanting too help thier costumers. Went in looking too get more info and help with opening a new account and they kept telling me too do that online. If I knew how to do it online I wouldn't have gone into the bank too get more information.Not helpful at all, came into make a new account and all bankers wereI’m here today and can attest this location is no good.

No one helps you until you ask them. Even then they give you incorrect information and default to sending you away rather than help you with banking needs.Fix the ATM!!!! OR AT LEAST SHUT IT DOWN AND STOP WASTING EVERYONES TIME!Don't waste you time trying to schedule appointments with bankers... they only have a few times available during the WHOLE MONTH!!  BUT when you arrive at the specific time, they DON'T honor your scheduled appointments!  Horrific customer service!Can yall fix the atm for once. Good lord it's always something. I'm right by the bank and can never use the atm. Now the touch screen doesn't work....coolGood bankSuper unhelpful.

Anthony Hall ensured we had all the options to move forward with our next visit. If you’re in the area, it is a very professional easy going branch.I want to give kudos to this branch.  I've banked here over 3 years and the professionalism shown by every one of the staff I've ever dealt with is why I continue to use them.  Anthony is wonderful, patient, and responsive.

Spoke to two people about potential issue with document; said no problem. Said they were booked for the day, so I made appt for next day. Went to branch at booked time and was told [1] they didn't have my appt and [2] they were busy/booked. I left. Wasted time and 15 miles RT. Otherwise, experience with this branch was very good; hence, the mixed rating.As it is in the Agricultural market, it so goes in the banking business. I’m not looking for a relationship, I have been married to the same beautiful person for 48 years.  I love Chase because they care about their customers and that is what most folks are looking for in a bank.Gwen is so kind! Amee needs to work on her customer service skills and toneI’ve been here 3 times now, and each time has been a pleasant and efficient experience. 🙂 …Rude personnel.","Positives:

78,Bank of America,"7900 Shoal Creek Blvd, Austin, TX 78757",Austin,"I use this location for the drive thru ATM service but the wireless tap feature is consistently broken on both machines and requires me to go to the ATM further south. I hate to leave a poor review but can someone at this bank call in these issues for repair or let me know they are working on this? I’ll be happy to update this review saying the Bank addresses this but it’s an ongoing issue.1 teller and a line of 8 people waiting to see one person. For a big bank- you can hire more people so customers aren’t waiting 1 hour for a cashiers check. Will be moving to a local bank that respects its customers time and money.The teller with mustaches is the best! I always come to this branch now no matter how far it is. He is polite, fast and super accurate. Thank you so much! And sorry I don't know your name, will ask next time.Everyone at this branch was great and helpful. Definitely would come back. Lobby leader was helpful and nice.My banker Heath was absolutely amazing. Quick and professional. I will go to Shoal Creek BOA for all my banking needs!","Positives:
- Polite and fast teller with mustaches
- Helpful and nice lobby leader

79,Bank of America,"12521 N Interstate Hwy 35, Austin, TX 78753",Austin,"When I arrived to this location on Sep 30th around 1pm I was attended by the lady in the kiosk, I wanted to request a credit card so she told me to seat down and wait, by 2:30 the bank was almost empty so I asked to other lady when will they attended me, the answer was “she didn’t tell anything to nobody about your request”. Very disappointed about this bank. I waste more than 1.5 hrs and didn’t get any solution to my request. Cero stars.Zory Correa at the Bank of America in north Austin in the tech ridge shopping area had me email sensitive corporate documents like the articles of Incorporation and EIN To her email listed on her business card instead of getting a business Banker and having it send to an encrypted inbox for businesses. She never asked my name or for my ID. My name is Charles Henderson and I'm the CEO of HEMDFAM INC est 1999. She disappeared to the bank for a good 7 minutes or so. She even said the check I had was good and I could go cash it at Wells Fargo. Made no phone call or anything to verify it. It is a bank of America account. I know that much.They don’t answer the phone at all. I have called this location during business hours 6 times on 6 different days, and no one has ever answered the phone. It is super inconvenient to have to go up to the office if you just have a question. It is clear that they just avoid the phones or are just too busy to answer. Either way, the staff is not helpful - bad client support.Whoever is managing this bank of America needs to be demoted not fired. They only have two tellers one who switches back and forth between drive thru and inside helping customers. They obviously are over worked and understaffed i know people need jobs. Do better seeing as how y'all have been having these reports for months and nothing has changed. Don't blame the workers blame the management. Took me 30+ minutes to complete a simple withdrawalSerious?! We come here to ask for changing some currency, the lady told us  “My team is not trained for this service”. And then we ask if we can change our PIN, she said, “For the moment we have other customers scheduled appointments, maybe you can do it at another bank.” The bank is empty, no one else except a couple sitting there.
They are too busy for doing nothing.Iris who works at the counter was very rude to me. She took out money from my check without asking me how I would like to pay for my check. When I asked her why she did that and offered to use cash, she rolled her eyes at me and just handed me my money. It was a very cold and unkind interaction.Beware a jugging robbery recently took place here and I’m not surprised.

From my personal experience I recently paid this branch a visit to withdraw a few thousands dollars, and while I lightly whispered to the teller that “I would like to withdraw $XXXX”,  this teller decided to repeat out loud and with zero courtesy back to me “So you want to withdraw $XXXX?”.

I just looked around nervously and uneasy because he was so loud literally every customers heard it. Not surprised that there has been a recent jugging incident here, the staff has zero situational awareness or care for the customers safety.

If you withdraw a big sum here, just go front Point A to Point B. Don’t make any stops in between, and if you are driving directly home after a big sum withdrawal make a few random extra turns just to make sure no one is following. Stay safe.I normally don't like going to the bank, but had an easy and quick experience here. The staff were friendly and helpful despite being busy. In particular Corina was very pleasant to work with! Will use this location for future needs.Don’t come without a shotgun and a ski mask. The long lines and terrible customer seduce are enough to make anyone seriously consider a career as a bank robber.Went to this location because I misplaced my debit card and was not able to lock it or replace it on the app, the Manager told me that i was needing to make an appointment, so I told her yes go head , she then come back and told me that the next appointment available was on the second week of June more than  10 days, she was so rude and unprofessionalMy bank card was suspended, and I called and told me to go to one of the branches. When I reached this branch, he refused to help me …Absolutely terrible service! No standards at all when it comes to customer service. HIRE PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHAT THERE DOING!! You have incompetent people handling money!!I've been sitting in this drive through for over 30+ minutes waiting to cash a check. I'm late for an appointment, my kid has to pee and I'm fuming. There were 2 cars ahead of me in line, its not a busy day. When I finally got to the window the clerk said ""give me just a moment I have a few clients ahead of you"" and walked away. Great, more waiting.....I'm changing banks.Hire some people that know what they’re doing. I walked in to get a signature guaranteed. Lady on the floor told me to make an appointment with the notary. So I made one. Notary told me I should make an appointment with Sean. So I did. Sean told me to make an appointment with the notary. ???????????The service here was absolutely horrible and the teller was no better.Never again!Incompetent people counting money.  2 clerks and has taken 25 minutes for each line to serve 1 customer.  Should be called Bank of Degenerates.Never enough tellers always a long line. Why bank here if you need to do everything online? I come here to deal with people about my accounts but apparently customer service is not important to Bank of America anymore.Bank of America is cool. The locations here in Austin are not. The bankers inside are cool. The amount of them is not. Every time I have interacted with an employee they give outstanding customer service even if the systems they are using are so backwards that they don't make any sense. If you come to this location or any Bank of America location in Austin... please allow two to three hours for the transaction to actually happen.Sadly, there is no ""zero stars"" option.
55 minutes in the drive-through.  30 for the car in front of me and 25 for me for a simple withdrawal.  The teller was very polite, explaining that this is the  only branch open after 4:00 pm.  If this is a regular occurrence, they should keep more locations open, perhaps even extend their hours so that normal people can go to the bank without having to take time of from work.  BofA can fix their problems, but it seems they don't want to.
It might be time to close my 33 year old account and move to a credit union.Bank of America generally has predatory parasitical lending practices, they find ways to nickel and dime you with checking and savings hidden fees (monthly maintenance $10/mo, savings to checking transfer fees $10 if you do more than 5 transfers a month, and account balance minimum fees $8/mo).
The service I've had at the Parmer/i35 Bank of America pushed me over the line. I scheduled a meeting with a banker a week in advance to close a joint checking account. I showed up on time and there was a big line, when I got to the front of the line it was 7 min past my appointment. The family in front of me had an 18 year old that wanted to open a credit card, they rolled out the red carpet for him and a banker met with him immediately. When I spoke with the bank associate about closing an account she seemed annoyed and said that was something I could do online. She informed me that I lost my spot 5 min after our scheduled meeting time, and I would need to schedule another appointment, the nearest availability was a few days out.
I'm taking my business to RBFCU.This place must have no workers cause I’ve been literally sitting in the commercial line over an hour. Bank of America needs to hire more people with good pay cause that may be the reason why nobody applying or staying… ridiculous to wait so long wells Fargo may unfortunately be better than bank of America and their just as bad smhIf I could give this bank a ZERO STAR I WOULD.

This is the worst bank on the face of this earth. Only 2 tellers working. Inside it takes 30+ mins to deposit. And 20+ mins in the drive thru to deposit.

On top of that the managers don’t want to hire other workers to make this a better bank.Every time I have to come in (because ATMs arent new and don’t have $100 bill option) the wait is 30-40mins. Usually just one teller working both inside and drive-thru. I dont have to come in often as i try to use ATM/mobile as much as possible but this is just ridiculous. Chase branch literally has at least 3 tellers working the same day. Its time to switch.We got 4:25 and a lady talk with attitude said we are done for todayThe worst BOA I’ve been to in my life. No greeter to tell you that your about to waste an hour of your time, understaff is an understatement, and the ATMs are outdated as you can’t select bills you want. Please don’t waste your time coming to this location.Alaska Airlines card holder for 6+ years and never missed a payment. I started using the card for travel purposes only and used it to add a carry on bag, but forgot to pay. After 3 months they called me and told me I was late, I instantly paid that day and apologized and went on with my life. Today I found out my entire account was closed and I lost my companion fare, annual fee and travel perks due to them closing the account. This was over a $40 late payment on a card I had spent 10k+ on and never missed a payment... and this is why I have never banked with these crooks.One teller working and at least 10 people in line. The drive-thru was even worse. Horrible experience. Just left.After all the bad reviews I read about this bank I was expecting to have a bad experience and I was pleasantly surprised. Zoraya was super helpful as well as other employees. I will definitely stay using this location.Came 20 minutes before closing and one person was infront of my in the drive thru, took them 30 minutes to do whatever they were doing, so when I got to the window they said that I was too late because store hours were over. Excuse me???Very rude and disrespectful. As well as unprofessional and untrained.The service is horrible, they won’t even care about the customer, zoraya correa a vp, she wont even value the customers a very rude.Nice customer service. Staff were very nice and willing to go above and beyond to assist.Sure would be nice if these banks hired some tellers or at the very least someone to answer the phone.So bad.....  Does anyone train those people or they just so lazy and won't help if they have to put just a bit of effort.

I do not know why you even opened if there is not use in you.Great service, I was lucky to meet Jonathan, he is very helpful and helped me do all I need.Best bank . Corina best manager:)Fast and understandable serviceThe worst BofA locationFew tellers, long lines. Drive thru doesn’t workingThey will keep you waiting for a long time, probably understaffed.Bad experience ever. Stay away from this place, slow staff don’t understand their job.Never ever stop by this location u gone waste 45 min in lane to get change 😡😡🤬🤬🤬😡🤬😡 …Only 1 teller ever. Staff this branch more.Not enough teller services, always takes longer than normal time, never seen any improvement in the serviceVery professional and accommodating.Very bad service zoraya is not professional,she cannot speak normally,no helpful…This bank is Terrible!

BOA badOkHorrible serviceExcellent service from each of the workers who were there on Saturday, September 9. Especially the attention and patience of Maria NaranjoTerrible service from the lady with glasses who asks you on the line what you are on, it's a shame I don't remember her name, look at the comments and stars, terrible service, I had to stop by today because she needs to do something on my account and I confirmed the terrible service and That lady made me come out, out of courage, check the complaints and stars and do something to improve the serviceBad treatment of the staff does not deserve a star thanks to the lady at the door I had a bad afternoon. She's the one with short hair and glasses, I don't remember her name.One of the workers did not want to assist me in Spanish but the person behind me did assist me in Spanish, what a bad staff.The cashier staff is rude.","Positives:

80,Bank of America,"3520 N Lamar Blvd, Austin, TX 78705",Austin,"Please exercise caution when using this ATM. It ate my card and the customer assistance line told me to “contact [my] financial institution.” In other words, it’s my problem—not theirs—that my card was stolen by their ATM. If I could give this drive-thru ATM zero stars, I would.Outstanding experience! I keep on arriving at the closing time and each time the staff is super friendly, positive and helpful (many thanks to Luis, Gris, Jeanette, Tanya, Itzel, Leo who did the extra mile with the excellent positive service each time depite the closing time already passed). The service is fast, accurate and no waiting line.Itzel was very helpful and professional. Got me in and out in a timely manner.
Thank goodness a good bank is so close to my business.Service. Great customer service people spoke they asked me was there anything else they can do for me? You can't beat that.Be prepared to wait 45 minutes+ to do even a simple transaction at this bank.  They will have 10 employees walking around, yet only one of them has a ""cash drawer"" meaning only one person can actually help the long line of customers.The bank manager Itzel was very helpful and professional. Excellent service and pleasant experience. Thanks, BoA.So I haven’t been here lately but I went in here all the time from 2018-2021. And I was the best BoA I’ve ever been to. I enjoyed going in every week because everyone that worked there was so nice and helpful. It’s a 5 star bank. In contrast the BoA on South Congress 78704 is the worst. It’s a one star. That’s the bank closest to me now and I avoid it at all costs by doing online banking. I had a poor experience there today and it made me think about how much better your location is.AVOID THIS RANCH! The most terrible experience I have ever had at a BOA ranch. Especially their staff Luis Lopez Cuestas who has the poorest knowledge about their service, and the worst attitude to the customer. She didn’t even fix my problem and all she want is for you open a new credit card. I will never come back to this ranch ever again.This location used to be great many years back. But its been going downhill the last few years. The final straw was when the bank manager insisted i sign another document bcs she was lazy to scan the original signed agreement for my safe into her system. They ACTUALLY REFUSED TO GIVE ACCESS TO MY PAID SAFE until i signed the new document in the spot. Thats a new kind of huslting and blackmail even after the safe was paid for months ago. I removed everthing immediately afterwards. Closing all accounts i have had there for 22 years. Absolute crooks.Very professional and efficient service. If you have to open a new account, it is the perfect place to visit. *Open SaturdaysATM didn't work right and ended up taking my check and cancelling my transaction.Thank you Ms. Jeanette for helped me other day with beautiful smile and warm welcome.

81,Bank of America,"12574 Research Blvd, Austin, TX 78759",Austin,"Horrible experience and customer service. Please avoid all Bank of America branches at all cost. You will not have access to your account or be able to deposit/withdraw funds. Also, to the social media team monitoring customer feedback: please stop posting generic responses, take accountability for your poor reviews and do better for your customers.

Update: To the social media team: ^alex, please do better and be more professional. Be advised that Bank of America does not provide safe or convenient banking for their customers.Not specific to this branch, people were nice there. But in general, Bank of America would rather pull out their own finger nails than help a customer who walks in any branch.

The party line 100% of the time at any location is to go on their mobile app or call customer service. As if I went out of my way to drive to a physical branch for fun.Their information desk is located right in front of the door and adjacent to the teller line so there is no expectation of privacy when you're explaining your banking business needs.

Additionally, set expectations for assistance because the bank branch will disagree with the information provided by their customer service call center and refuse to assist.The experience is really bad. My brother had come as an international student and opened a checking and savings account recently. We visited this center to apply for a credit card for him. The women was really rude and aggressive. Instead of talking about the credit card, she started questioning why would my brother open a savings account being a student. She started giving us wrong information about fees and started saying that he will not be able to afford it and asked us to close the savings account. I came to the country 10 years back as a student and i know for a fact that being a student and less than 25yrs old will have any fees waived. She even got aggressive and said someone provided wrong info and asked us to report them. She even pointed at my brother and said that he is new to the country, there is a lot of fraudulent people and hope he is not one among them but its hard for BofA to know that.

Always heard about streotyping people but never encountered one in my stay in this country. But what I experienced today felt like we were being stereotyped.

I dont mind having my brother being denied a credit card but the way she explained that was stereotypical and really inappropriate. I am not interested in naming the person but would advise the entire center to provide being proper training in customer service.

Though this is 1 person in one BofA location, i am planning to take my business somewhere else. Thinking of closing and moving all our accounts from BofA.  Worst experience of all!!!I've been banking at this location since I was 15. I'm 54 now. It's totally gone downhill. I have a typical checking and savings. If you don't keep $10000 in savings, they charge you $25 a month. Same for checking. That comes out to $600 a year for both.I don't pay it for savings due to balance. I now use Austin Telco for checking its free.I had a safety deposit box, but they raised the price to over $150 a year at that price I had safe installed at the house. it's cheaperBOA has no regard for the deceased or their families.  The process for handling an estate is very cumbersome, sadly.  The system is broken and needs to be looked at while showing a little empathy to grieving families.It’s so frustrating dealing with this Bank of America branch. I’ve been a BofA customer for a while. Usually, anything online is fairly simple and straightforward. Dealing with the branch is like dealing with a very different company that can’t seem to get out of their own way. My most recent interaction was ordering cash. Called them multiple times on Wednesday. No one EVER answers. Went in on Thursday and spoke to the teller. She said she’ll place the order on Monday and they might be able to get it Tuesday or Wednesday. I get a call on Monday from a Florida number saying they can’t fulfill the order until possibly the end of the week and I need to call back in to confirm the order. I called the Florida number multiple times (and the loca branch) but one answers and I’m left receiving unanswered voicemails.

The only reason I stick with them is the ATMs. In todays world that seems less important and this frustration may be what forces me to change.Even tho it may look intimidating is it very pretty much the opposite lol. Very respectful and helpful staffing and they actually have a restroom that’s nice :)We visited from out of town and spoke to a wonderful business banker by the name of Jeffrey Carrillo. He was very knowledgeable and professional. He explained all the banking services that we needed and took his time in making sure our needs were met. We truly appreciated this and even thought we are not local to Texas we will definitely be keeping in touch. Thank you Jeffrey!!Made an appointment for notary service at 10.30. I arrived at 10.20. I waited 30 mins to be seen.
This notary lady in pink was sitting across me inside her see through glass office the whole 30 mins I was waiting, NOT on the phone OR with client.
She's probably on the internet instead of working. No apology for making me wait 30 mins while she is literally free. Once I sat down, she told me she cannot do notarize/true copy unless I go out of state?? What kind of excuse is that? It sounds so uneducated or pure lazy. Just tell me you didn't bring your stamp that day instead of telling me to travel across the state. Ended up going to Pak Mail 5 mins away and got what I need without going to the airport.Good afternoon. I myself have been living in our nice town for over three decades now and been with Bank Of America for almost two decades. I wanted to take a moment to thank both Ms. Carly and Ms.Andrea for the excellent service provided by then for me this morning. Being that it's considerate and honorable employees like those two sweet young ladies that is why Bank Of America continues to be one of those successful Banks in our country. Most people are decent and productive people during the times when things are going well. What defines our character is how we ourselves conduct ourselves during times like right now while we face uncertain situations like the Covid virus among other issues. This is why I myself continue to support honorable people like those of Bank Of America as well as equally decent and productive people working for other lending instructions as well. As well as the excellent staff of HEB. Shipt, St. David's hospital as well others whom continue to work around the clock to proving excellent service for others. So please folks we are indeed in this situation together. So the next time you personally are having a less than perfect day please keep in mind the similar challenges being faced by equally decent and worthy and relevant people whom are serving you for the moment. And when the service is completed perhaps you should show them some appreciation by asking how their own day is going. And be sure to say thank you for the service provided for you by them. Again folks most people in our country and world are indeed decent people. So let's all practice what we ourselves preach. And treat others with the same politeness that we ourselves wish to be treated. Regardless of what kind of day we ourselves may be having at the moment.This branch is extremely helpful respectful and knowledgeable the lines are always moving fast and the workers are extremely nice and all around the best customer service at a bank America I’ve ever had thank you so much 183 in Oak Knoll branchPoor customer service they closed my sister account without any explanation I don’t recommend itWorst bank I've ever been to.update hours online if you are going to be temporarily closed!Very helpful staffs and a manager!Very rude.

There are 2 other locations that would be quicker and easier for me to go to every day but I literally go out of my way to go to this location! You cannot beat the service you receive here and the staff are all the most wonderful people you'll encounter. Jonathan and Josue are fantastic as well as every single one of the tellers! I always leave here happy and satisfied and actually enjoy coming to the bank! :)The people there are very nice. However, this location is understaffed and wait times are far too long.Special shout out to Jonathan from this branch. He was eager to help and has strong knowledge. It was my fourth branch since morning [I had visited 3 different braches but they turned me back as I had no appointment]. Jonathan provided me options and work arounds to solve my issue and save my day. He did not have appointment at his branch as well, but he was able to solve my issue which was a common ask.Waited for an hour to deposit check into my account but still staff couldn’t able to help with the deposit. They said they are waiting for approvals and I don’t have any idea how many more hrs I need to wait to get it done. I left and visited another branch which is near by, they deposited in 5 min.I got fantastic support from Maria Fernanda. She was super patient and polite to help out with multiple queries. She provided a lot of information without asking, big thanks..Horrible horrible horrible teller service. Waited in line for about 40 minutes. Only one teller.  Other employees not doing anything. I ask greeter if there were other tellers and she said they did not have any others.  Not acceptable!Truly, so unbelievably pathetic. They closed all their branches for Covid, funny all the other financial institutions managed to figure it out without closing 80% of their banks. I will be sure to go out of my way to never use B of A in the future.Location is temporarily closed with no notification what so ever.Needs more cashier/clerk  it's super slow I been waiting over 35 minutes in line they had 2 cashier now down to 1 still waiting not good for businessHow do you not have one teller in an operating bank?

After 15 years and the continued poor customer service, I decided to close my account altogether because it’s just not worth the hassle or frustration. It looks like they’ve done nothing to fix the ATM either so please beware, they do not provide safe or convenient banking:I had the most absurd and terrible experience at the Bank of America, Walden Park branch on May 17th. When I first went into the bank to make a deposit, the employee at the counter told me he couldn't make a deposit for me because they didn't have any bank tellers. He then instructed me to go make the deposit at the ATM. I told him that I didn't want to because I was depositing a lot of money and bills and was worried something might go wrong with the ATM. He kept insisting that I go to the ATM, so eventually I was forced to go to the ATM to deposit my money. And of course, as I deposited all the cash, the ATM crashed and I ended up losing almost $2000. I went inside to talk to the employee and he told me to call the number provided on the ATM machine. I called and then they told me to speak to their claims department. I always count all my bills before I go to the bank so I informed them of how much money I lost. They apologized to me on the phone. They told me on the phone he couldn't do anything. After I went back inside the bank, the same employee that told me because they didn't have any tellers they couldn't do my deposit started attending to other customers inside the teller box. I had to spend over an hour at the bank like that. I had a lunch appointment with friends, but because I was exhausted from spending so much time at the bank, I couldn't keep that appointment. So, I wanted to speak to the branch manager, and the manager tried to explain why I had to use the ATM machine. I didn't want to hear their explanation; what I wanted was a genuine apology.  The bank employees there witnessed the whole situation, and the manager and I had no choice but to argue. There was a Korean employee next to the branch manager (his name was Mr. Lee), so I asked him in Korean, 'Mr. Lee, is what I'm doing wrong?' He was taken aback by my sudden question in Korean and didn't respond. Then the branch manager told him not to respond and Mr. Lee left. I don't understand the significance of having business cards that say 'Certified Arabic Speaker' and 'Certified Korean Speaker' placed in front of the bank counter if we aren't allowed to speak with those 'certified speakers'. I still haven't received the $2,000 deposit, and I'm still affected by the aftermath of that day!--Very helpful and humble staffs. I'm amazed with the way they help customers. All our queries are answered and the process was seemless. Especially the bank officers were very polite and humble. Thank you very much.I would be concerned if I were a BoA customer. I've tried since last week to open a commercial account for a hotel we just purchased and have been unable to locate ANYONE WHO CAN HELP FACILITATE THIS.
Tried for several days via phone (College Station location) and then physically went in to this Lake Creek Park location and was told ""go somewhere else - we do not have anyone here who can help you.""  The place was empty and there were very few lights even on the building.... it doesn't get much worse than this.Never had this kind of bad experience with a BoA branch before. I went in at 9.50am (branch opens at 9) and the single cashier was busy with counting cahd till 10.10am. No eye contacts from her. I asked the manager how much more time it will be, as I need to rush for an appointment. She refused to give me a time and I told her I will try the next branch if it will take more than 5 minutes. She said it's your choice. No apologetic tone. Very cold. Extremely disappointed.This is the worst branch of BOA I have ever been to.  They only have one teller and the line is always long.  If only one teller is all they mean to have they might as well close this branch because it is almost useless.  I hope someone at BOA is reading these reviews.Really, really bad. Random hours and services.  Today, you couldn't even get money out of your account.  No joke.  Sometimes,  they'll just close all day for ""circumstances beyond our control"" and now they only stay open until 4.  This branch is almost useless.  It's the closest to me, but I'm always wondering if they'll be open, even if it's just Tuesday at 11am.  Bank of America as a whole kinda sucks.  Used to be a good bank.  Now, they pretty much hate customers.Try to make a deposit and the branch was closed. The two ladies there just said that the branch was closed and that they didn’t know when it would be open. One was annoyed that a person asked for an alternative and wasn’t able to provide one. They were rude and unprofessional. There are now very few alternative branches in the area that truly open.
I may have to change banksExcellent treatment from who attended us.  We made the appointment and they attended us in a personal and super friendly way.  The manager made us feel very during the appointment and she resolved all our doubts.Came here cashed a b of a check no problem. There is only one teller but if you go during non rush hours no problemWorst manager was working today at this branch. Vulgar, tactless and rude woman. I hate when this kind of people works in banking sector.Rude employees.  I had a simple question, yet had to make an appointment.  They were rude, dismissive and unprofessional.  They also had one teller and one customer service person.  I have found this true at every branch.I don't know why there's so many bad reviews, the teller was fast and was spot on knowing what she was doing. She made things super easy.So I opened a account online about a month ago. Everything fine I never really used it. So today I go into the branch and deposit 1000 into my account. Everything fine again. I go home try to access online banking it says not available to me. So naturally I call the bank like where's my money. They tell me my IDENTITY COULD NOT BE VERIFIED MY IDENTITY (Remember THE Accounts BEEN OPEN A MONTH ALREADY). AO IM LIKE WAIT I JUST WALKED INTO A BRANCH AND DEPOSITED MONEY WHAT YOU MENA. THEN THEY TELL ME AGAIN COULDNT VERIFY MY IDENT SO I SAY OK GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK SINCE ISNT THIS THEFT?? YOU JUST STOLE MY MONEY THEN HE SAYS THEY WILL MAIL THE BALANCE TO THE ADDRESS IM LIEK BUT U CANT VERIFY MY IDENTY BUT HAVE ALL MY INFORMATION?? IM CONTACTING MY LAWYER SOMETHING ABOUT THIS DOESNT SEEM AT ALL LEGALAwesome customer service.Brandon thanks for everything you help me withNEVER WORKS!!! Just close it down at this point.Drive through ATM touch screen doesn’t respond.Just 1 person on the counter everyday and waiting time is almost 20 min

Come on, hire 1 more personAdvertised as open until 4pm.  Doors locked at 10:51am.the worst of worst experience with all, very slow and unhelpful. decided to change my bank to somewhere elseATM doesn’t workNice bankSpanish / English

My name is Maidelys Hernandez and I never thought that it would be possible for a banking institution to STEAL MY MONEY... I am telling you my story so that Bank of America located at 9830 N Lake Creek Pkwy will not dare to make transactions. It turns out that I withdraw from my account through a bank worker 1420 and he gives it to me in an envelope, I leave the bank and go to make a Money Order in another store, it turns out that when I took out the money there was 100 false and mistreated dollars, I return to the bank to be delivered another bill AND TO MY SURPRISE...THE WORKER TOLD ME NO...THAT THEY DID NOT GIVE ME THAT TICKET SINCE THE MACHINE HAD DETECTED THE FALSE TICKET.....I mean...I am the LIAR. ..THE ONE WHO WANTS TO ROB THE BANK...I IMMEDIATELY CALL THE EMERGENCY FOR THEM TO TAKE CHARGE BECAUSE THE SECURITY CAMERAS WILL SAY IF THEY GAVE IT TO ME OR NOT...once they have to GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK...DE ONCE I CLOSE MY ACCOUNT BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT AN INSTITUTION THAT YOU CAN TRUST TO SAVE YOUR MONEY... I HOPE YOU SEE MY COMMENT SO THEY ARE PENDING.

84,Bank of America,"11500 FM 2222, Austin, TX 78730",Austin,"I voice other complaints about this branch, terrible customer service - had tried twice to do a wire transfer to close real estate transactions...once, I had to patiently wait the agent finish talking (very relaxed) to another bank employee for about 15min. I even asked the apparently manager what I needed, with certain urgency (deadline set by the title company)  but the guy almost rudely said he could do nothing and I should wait...when finally I got to speak with the agent, it took almost 45min to complete the transaction - 2nd time with same issue that he could not explain...This branch is horrible. They stop answering the phones 15 minutes to close. Doors locked promptly. They don’t care about your business.I just wanted to mention by name the rather rude bank manager, James, who apparently works here for some unknown reason. If I owned a business who dealt with other people’s money, I wouldn’t want a person such as this managing my branch. He was quite rude to my wife, and he was also quite rude to the bank teller right in front of my wife for no good reason. A simple money wire might’ve been too difficult for James to handle with any sort of composure. How someone with such poor interpersonal skills makes manager is beyond me. Most likely, I’m not the only person to complain about James. Hopefully, in due time he will be canned. Happy New Year James!BOA customer for over 20 years and got treated with no respect. He asked 3TIMES if I had an account. Did he not hear me the first 2 times? I have over 1/2 a million. That will change TODAY!!!Guess I should have dressed up. All i needed was a notary. 4Points is the only one that won't help with this. All the other BOAs do.Worthless location they don't want to help or offer proper attention to customer concerns. Acting nonchalant and put off if you ask them to sit down and help explain anything that is going on in your account.. told me to call the customer care number for myself. So rude I didn't even want their help anymore... went to ATM pulled out money and called customer care for myself. I got hit with a SPECTRUM fraud and my money still not returned. I am negative $1000.00 still. Once my money is finally returned I will be leaving this bank after many times this bank has failed to properly protect or help. Any other bank would have had my funds back to me immediately and offered proper assistance. The people at this branch are truly unhelpful...... dress up snazzy and stand there like 👍 your customers are an inconvenience to you .....this place totally dead empty and yet have the odasisity to act like sitting down with me is an inconvenience. Please retrain this awful location how to proper assist the public.This branch location of Bank of America is useless. They don’t answer their phone and make it impossible to talk to a real person. I made an appointment for a particular service  that the website let me schedule, only to find out that they couldn’t do what I needed at this location. This isn’t the first time I’ve had an issue at this branch. Save yourself time and don’t bank here.WORST Bank of America ever. Remodeled it where there is only one bank teller, waited for 20 min in line for them to tell me they can’t do that, and to order it through the app and come back days later. They were extremely rude, made a comment as I was walking away “that’s what the app is for”.I wish I could give it a zero-star rating.

They are very lazy, unprofessional, and have no idea how their bank operates. It is a shame that BofA doesn't take the time to enlighten/train their associates and managers on how their bank operates or the processes of banking.

I took money orders I already filled out, but was not used for the intended purpose to this location - twice!
The first time I went there, I told the cashier that I'd like to deposit the money orders I bought with my BofA debit card back into my account. I had all the receipts for the purchases. I was told they can not deposit the money orders because it will look fraudulent. Okay, I went home and called their customer support because I was perplexed. An agent confirmed to me on the phone that they can deposit the money orders even if they are filled out at a local branch.
So, I went back to this branch for the second time and told them what has been confirmed to me. The cashier took me to the manager, and I explained to her my plight. She also to me they cannot deposit the money orders even with all my receipts and the BofA debit card I used for the purchases. Unbelievable!

I decided to take the money orders to my Navy Federal bank - 35 mins from where I live.
Got to the cashier, and told her I have money orders I purchased but didn't use for the intended purpose and I'd like to have my money back. She said, sign and write at the bank of each ""Not used for the purpose intended"". She deposited the money orders and gave me the cash. As simple as that!

Why make banking so difficult for people?I’m very happy with the service of Bank of America. I always try to go with Lissana. She always goes far and beyond. Even though I don't have  an appointment she is always willing to help. Im very satisfied with the service . I have 4  years with my account and Alamo’s three years going to the Same office because I feel comfortable and happy with the service provided . Thank you Lissana.Extremely happy wit this location. Everybody is super kind, especially Lissana who is always ready to help! She always helps you to solve any inconvenience or need you may have, and at the same time she tries to give you advices of what is better for you.excellent customer service, one of the young ladies(i forget her name at the moment, I think her last name was Goodwin) helped me and my mom she was amazing!!
There are some things about the overall bank system that I do not like but besides that everything is fine!Do not come to this branch if you can help it. You will just be deferred to customer care by the manager. Then customer care is going to defer you back to the branch. Been a customer for over a decade, and this branch makes me want to take my money elsewhere.Branch manager has terrible interpersonal and management skills. I had just learned my father died tragically abroad and needed documents notarized to recover his body. The staff there had been amazing and helped me with preliminary papers, including bilingual services. I had a document that had been updated by the U.S. Embassy and required a notary to complete. There were no customers in the branch. Nonetheless, the branch manager was insisting I leave and schedule an appointment online. Knowing the critical nature of the document and the urgency, he simply refused to help me despite the fact there were numerous employees available and no customers in the bank or the drive thru. Thankfully, a staff member intervened and offered to notarize the document while  the branch manager continued to badger me about ""next time."" It was unbelievable. As a preferred Merrill Lynch wealth management customer, it really has me thinking about letting them continue to manage anything of mine.The staff here are great, once they get to you. I do my best to avoid coming in but when I have to I can never get in and out in less than an hour. This branch is totally understaffed.They remodeled this location and now only have one teller window and long lines. What ever happen to customer service. Who was the genius that thought of this remodel and let's not forget the drive through is no longer in existence.Lissana and the management team were extremely helpful during a recent visit to correct some issues that had come up. They were knowledgeable and comforting when faced with challenges that were slightly outside of what I would consider normal.This branch is remodeled and I had good experience overall. I would agree that there’s only one counter but the branch manager was helpful and attentive.Lissana is wonderful and helpful. She explained everything very good. Also she is very patience for somebody new. This branch is going to be my branch now.I am so grateful to all the staff, especially Jason, they were very nice to me, diligent, helpful, and found solutions.  I am very grateful to them.  Tina is an Angel.Stop closing all of your branches!  No wonder you are losing all of your business to online banking.  I would have never been your customer if I would have known that your customer service was so horrible.Lissana helped me and my husband a lot, explaining with patience everything, she’s very kind.Jennifer was amazing she has great customer service definitely will be coming back for her help!Josh did a very good job explaining a complicated matter and providing workable options.Lissana was very helpful and knowledgeable. She was very patient and kind.  Thank you for all your help.Tina (Manager) was super Awesome, very knowledgeable with great customer experience.Thank you so much for helping! Got my digital card set up thanks to Tina!My Teller Jenna was helpful expidient and accurateExcellent and perzonalized customer attentionLissana is wonderfulTerrible experience! I do not recommend this branch and Bank of America in general. When I can I will cancel my account. There is only one cashier and one has a very bad character and the lady does not give confidence.
Do not recommend this place. Only one teller, unprofessional, nasty clients, very uncomfortable. When I can, I will close my account and credit card from here.Lisana is an excellent professional with good dedication to her clients. Careful attention, very complete information about opening accounts and credit cards.How good the attention of this branch, especially the attention of Lisana Goodwin, who takes care of me in such a way that it was spectacular.Excellent customer service, very friendly and trained to solve the problems to be dealt withExcellent attention from Lissana!! Excellent attention from Lissana!!As always with the best attitude and excellent service Lissana, thank you!!Lisana, a person with excellent service, very convinced of her attention.Lissana Goodwin excellent Attention Thank you very good attentionExcellentExcellent attentionfascinated with attention","Positives:
- Some employees, such as Lissana and Jennifer, provide excellent customer service and are knowledgeable and helpful.
- Remodeled branch location is praised by some customers.
- Some customers appreciate the patience and kindness of certain employees, like Lissana.
- Staff members, like Tina and Jason, are commended for being diligent, helpful, and finding solutions for customers.

- Some customers express frustration with the bank's policies and the lack of training for associates and managers.

Miscellaneous:

85,Bank of America,"2501 S Congress Ave, Austin, TX 78704",Austin,"Just another and slow service  with bad attitude customer service yessss it is Bank of America is a big line and just one teller wowwww other wise I have to use this location please be more fast and reliable team thank you!!!!Hi, Grecia the manager waited on my brother and I. After we waited  45 minutes in the waiting area. She helped my brother get a new debit card. She was very helpful, patient and understanding. We truly appreciate her assistance. Thank you, Rose and Pat R.This branch has a phone but they choose not to answer it.  I have been trying to get them to answer for over 15 minutes.  The Bank of America web site is down for scheduling appointments too.  I guess it is time to find a new bank to do business with.They have an aisle and a sign for business clients. I enter and wait. 3 people go ahead of me in the other line. Then Im informed to wait in that line. I would happily have waited from the beginning.
20 minutes later. 1 tellerI opened a new account with them at this location the lady was very nice of course I was opening a new account. I went back to make a deposit the lady at the counter said why are u making a deposit with me why not use the atm? (In a rude way like I was bothering her) I said does it really matter how I want to deposit my money isn’t that what u are here for? Than I proceeded to ask some questions about my account she acted like it was just to much for her. Rude staff I am switching banks asap. There were 3 more angry customers before me saying they were going ti switch also . All she kept telling them was couldn’t help to call the number on the card or just being plain rude !!! Not even worth 1 star terrible location.Teller (as in one for the 10 people in here at a time) is always friendly, but there needs to be more than one. it's not like BOA can't afford another.
I actually go to this BOA because the one on Stassney Ln. near my house has a wait that is usually twice as bad. If you are coming here expect to sit in line a while.
I use a credit union as well. it sits about a mile and a half away and my girlfriend uses a different credit union a few blocks away. 5 minute wait either credit union. The problem is not that the area is too busy or anything of that nature. BOA simply does not care about their account holders or the workload of the people they employ.
Need more proof they don't care, look at the literally dozens of reviews all complaining about the same problem. A problem that has persisted for years. Every complaint is about not having enough tellers, or staff being rude (because they are dealing with too many people). If they cared they would have looked at these and fixed the problem. Instead they give a disingenuous apology message and act like it is some great mystery or force beyond their control. It is not.
Bank somewhere where they do not act like they are doing you a favor when your money goes into their bank. Don't pay for checking and don't pay predatory overdraft fees.The Bank of America building is not pretty.  The person that helped me open an account when I closed my Chase account seemed helpful.  She seemed to get that it might not be the right bank for me even though I felt forced to open an account there.  I feel scared to use my card because I’m afraid of it.  There were alot of Latino families that looked like they needed quick loans in the lobby but I’m not trying to assume anything.  I haven’t spoken to a teller aside from once when I depositrd a check. The security gaurds outside of The building looked like they were beaten with sticks.  I don’t want to do anything but use a bank like a normal person.  I’m not okay with any lies.Switching to Chase. I've had BoFA for 15 years and their customer service has continually gotten worseSent one of our employees to the bank for $621 in change but only received back $611 in change. After paying our employee mileage reimbursement for the initial trip to the bank as well as their time waiting in line for service, 30 minutes, I thought the shortage could be resolved with a simple phone call. My mistake; no one at this location picked up the phone even after repeatedly dialing the branch for 20 minutes between 3:20pm - 3:40pm. Now, we have to make a 2nd trip to the bank, pay our employee for additional mileage and their time waiting in line a 2nd time and it's all for $10.  Shame on you Bank of America.Worse service ever, this location couldn't even help with resetting a pin and their customer service phone line is ridiculous.Don’t even deserve 1 star.  Customer service is horrible, managers don’t care, tellers are rude. Wait time is over an hour, the Drive -thru is permanently closed , there’s NO signs that it’s out of service.  Negative employees and bad management are what causes business to close.This is the closest branch to where I live. Every time I had to go in to see the cashier, there was only one person working there (always in a bad mood) with a line of at least 7-8 people. Every time I try to talk to the cashier here it takes about 30 minutes.
Overall, they have terrible customer service at this branch!I had to wait for 1h after my scheduled appointment time! But then I received really good treatment. So mixed feelings.Probably the worst customer service experience in the United States. Avoid.So many people , nobody working… waiting in line for people to get their act togetherI feel like this place is ran by people who have no idea what they are doing on top of being rude. I get it, 1 teller and a bunch customers come in at once, I'll be mad also. This the normal for this branch. SMHAccount opening was super smooth. All the staff are super helpful especially Yazmin who helped step by step and answered all my questions during opening a new account.
PS: Not sure why there are such bad reviews.The worst service!   Regardless of wait times, they are extremely under staffed.   I desperatly needed a debit card replacement and arrived 20 minutes before closing time. I was told they were too busy and we’re about to make me leave anyway because they’re closing.  Obviously, I can’t say  this about other branches but this one is terrible.Why isn't there more then one teller. The lines are to long include the wait as well. They need to come up with a better system. Management is the blame. Fix it.Listed hours are until 2pm on Saturday. I got there at 1:50 and all the lanes and lobby were closed. Tried to call and they never pick up the phone.Long lines with one worker helping. Others just sit in their office on the cell phone.I went thier to order another debit card for my wife ,but the service was not good, I asked one of the guys working thier his name is Kevin Garcia he was putting his hand on his Puckett and talking to me very rude I told him my wife she doesn't speak a good English thats why we are here ,but he said u have to call customer service or came back another day, even the branch was open and they were only 2 people front of me ,he was not professional at all I really feel bad .Homero Salas is nice and kind, provides good service.High wait times, poor customer service, unable to help with small requests. I don’t recommend anyone use Bank of America but if you do avoid this location at all costsI used the drive through atm and the curb scraped up the bottom of my car. They need to fix the that area it’s literally a accident waiting to happenPeople's accounts are still getting hacked into and money being stolen from customers and these people at Bank of America do not insure or protect your money, and are telling me there is nothing they can do.Terrible. Extremely slow service, understaffing, and just no need for this branch to even exist. Go somewhere else.You’re bound to run into an interesting cast of characters at this bank… That’s all I’ll sayTerrible customer service I was on the phone for 30 minutes and I couldn’t talk to anyoneVary bad service at this location, they need more workers here.. bad attitude and very disrespectful!Never open during office hours called the store no answerIt was excellent with Shela at Bank of America.They have great team, everyone just want to helpHORRIBLE BANK
HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICEI made a deposit, but the ATM broke down, so they didn't accept all my money, nor did they return it, I contacted the staff, they kindly solved my problem temporarily, but in the end it turned out that if they took my money ($900), it won't be as they did the investigation, but, in the first place, I would not have contacted them, if the same receipt did not ask me to do so, which indicates that there was clearly a problem, but only I ended up losing.If I could give 0 stars, I give them a bad service, it is impossible that without a passport, having an account in this bank, having another identification, they cannot help users with any of the bankFor me, I have had the best service, they treat me like family, everyone from all the bad comments, I don't understand why people are like that.","Positives:
- The manager, Grecia, was very helpful, patient, and understanding in assisting a customer with getting a new debit card.
- The teller at the branch is always friendly.
- The account opening process was smooth and the staff, especially Yazmin, were helpful and answered all questions.
- Homero Salas provides good service and is nice and kind.
- Shela at Bank of America provided excellent service.

Room for improvement:
- Slow service and long wait times, especially due to inadequate staffing and only having one teller.
- Some staff members have been rude and unhelpful to customers.
- The bank does not answer their phone when customers try to call.
- The Bank of America website has been down for scheduling appointments.
- The drive-thru lane is permanently closed without any signage.

Miscellaneous:
- The bank branch building is not visually appealing.
- The security guards outside of the building looked unkempt and battered.
- Some customers have had their accounts hacked into and money stolen.
- The location has received a significant number of negative reviews indicating ongoing issues with customer service and staffing.
- People have had mixed experiences with the bank, with both positive and negative interactions."
86,Bank of America,"9701 Research Blvd, Austin, TX 78759",Austin,"I came to visit in the area, and found the opportunity to open an account for my elder mom in this branch. Mrs. Angella, and Mr. John the manager were exceptional!!! I came all the way from San Antonio, because they are not willing to help, they just say straight ""No"" to people from outside the US, but here in this bank they were willing to help the customer, they were looking their procedures and options to to help us, and they did!

Thank you guys, you earn heaven and a loyal customer, great customer service, cordial, respecftul, willing to help and go the extra mile, they set up realistic expectations and I'm thankful for your support and patience, specially Mrs. Angie with my elder mom, my kids and myself, absolutely amazing!!!

Again thank you to Mr. John and the male cashier  (sorry don't remember the name) all 3 of you deserve a bonus, and you guys are keepers, and Bank of America should know about this, and I will recommend this branch to my friends and family.Just  came back to B of A /moving back to Texas. Alex Lou Tang helped me. He was so nice, helpful, and efficient!Unlike other customers, I was surprisingly satisfied with the great service I had at this branch - I was able to be served even not having made an appointment, waiting time was short; relationship mgr Alex did everything he could to help me complete a wire transfer; in the end, due to a system error, we were not able to conclude it at the agency, but him and the other employee helped me to do that online. Great service!Many thanks to branch team! Especially to manager, Srininas, Angella. You all helped me so much. I'll never forget you. Very friendly and professional team.Today was my first visit to the Gateway / Arboretum branch on Research Blvd to do a simple transaction during mid afternoon.

While on line, which was not long at all, a lady banker approached me.  She invited me over to the counter and assisted me with my simple task - making a deposit - even though it was just a pair of men in front of me  preparing their paperwork.

I am very impressed with the courtesy and professional demeanor of  the lady banker, and it is that which will bring me back to this branch for my banking needs in the future. The lady banker is Veronica and she is the manager.

If you have any banking needs, be sure to visit the branch at Research by N.  Capital of Texas Hway, and you will experience a professional atmosphere.We loved this department! We came without an appointment, we were offered an interpreter in Ukrainian, they served us quickly! The guy greeting people is friendly and mega lively!Unprofessional staff. The black female cashier is way beyond unprofessional and rude and the Hispanic manager is completely disrespectful and unprofessional, I was waiting for him help me with the name update and another customer showed up, I was completely ignored.Don’t come here if you want to receive a good customer service experience. They will do and say anything not to help you. Went to a different bank and got all the help I needed in one visit.One month ago I went to BOA in Pflugerville and the didn’t have money! Now I’m at BOA on Research and Capital of Texas Hwy and they don’t have a teller. Apparently she’s out to lunch so I need to wait 30 minutes for her to return. Meanwhile the other employees are useless because they can only greet customers. What is happening to BOA? They used to be a reliable bank. Thinking of changing banks.I had the pleasure of working with Mike Shabaan and can’t say enough good things! Give him a raise and a promotion! I was in and out of the branch within five minutes doing a complicated international wire!

I came in 5/22 with a lot of assorted bills which totaled 1000 and he used the machine to count it which kept stopping. He told me I had 885 bucks which was not the case so I told him could he count it and he tells me no it would take too long; he needs a new job. I went to a different Bank of America and my total was 1000.The employee standing at the door speaks rudely.Very knowledgeable and helpful staff.

You truly made my day and I can’t thank you enough!!!The absolute worst bank in the country. Locked the door in my face because I arrived at 4:00 on the dot. I had $200,000 I had to deposit TODAY. Since when did they start closing at 4 o’clock? I can’t wait to switch banks, which we’re in the process of doing.They keep us waiting more then 30 mins outside of the door. Man it’s too hot outside..SEVERELY understaffed. I wish that even expressed adequately the situation at this location. 1 teller for a line of 6-12 people. The managers walk around with tablets doing nothing. Their phones go unanswered which is irritating when you just want to know if there’s a notary available or not. STAY AWAY FROM THIS LOCATION.Went here two times waited 3x the time they said it would be and had to leave before getting helped both times… didn’t have any issues with the exact same request at RBFCU down the road… so frustrating.The worst banking experience I have ever experienced. Unfortunately, this matches my experience at other locations. Will never use BOA again. Ever. Lies from tellers and customer service and people don't want to help you do what you need to do.

Run to literally any other bank.Long waits every time, 3 to 4 people working on loans and other services but only one to hand teller and any business that you may have once you have an accountThey choose who they help and who they make wait. I heard a woman who came in after me say she didn't have an appointment and she got taken care of immediately. Also dismissive and rude with their interactions.Come at the middle of the day, there were no queues to wait. Nice manager.Thank you for great service.

89,Bank of America,"5800 W Slaughter Ln STE 200, Austin, TX 78749",Austin,"Phoebe was so efficient and gracious. Best experience I have had at Bank of America. This was for an international wire. One of the most kind and easy to work with of all the personal bankers. Thanks for making my day!I went in to ask about my finances and was told by the only cashier someone would help me in a couple minutes. Not a problem until all the advisors started packing their things up. notably seeing me waiting and started talking about going to Wendy’s for lunch. Blatantly ignoring the fact that  I was the only ONE waiting. Anyway, they all left together for lunch and when I asked the cashier when they’d be back he said “I don’t know, in an hour?”. I left and went to another BOA and received great service.ATM ate a very large deposit after hours. Was on hold for literally hours to address the issue.

Edit *added in response the owner* : I was on the phone for hours before my call was disconnected. Then, my husband drove back to the bank the following morning. Your in-store associates literally told him there was absolutely nothing they could do about it. They suggested he would have to call the main hotline. At which point, it took another hour of waiting.I made an appointment online to talk to a loan rep at 5800 Slaughter Ln branch. My appointment was confirmed & when I got to the bank, I find a sign that says temporarily closed! I never received a notification that the bank was closed or that my appointment was canceled!

91,Bank of America,"8616 I-35, Austin, TX 78745",Austin,"The teller basically told me because my name is Michael and not Mike, they can't cash a check a customer gave me. That is rediculous and really poor service on the part of a financial institution serving their customers.  I understand if the check is illegible or damaged but denying me payment from one of their customers accounts that they use to pay folks is inconvenient and I can just go to a different Bank of America and get it cashed there no problem.   I always get checks writing to me as Mike and there's rarely an issue. The other time a bank did this they also got a negative review.  This is also why I don't bank here as they denied me cashing my own checks on my brand new account with them.Nice location. They bug you too much in line though..
This location is Closed on Saturday and Sunday.

Unfortunately the last two times I’ve deposited money in the drive through ATM, the same vagrant that hangs out at the bus stop approached my car asking for money. The most recent time he squeezed between the atm and my car door!  Guy is got to get hurt if he pulls that with the wrong person.I had a great experience at the Bank of America at 1144 Airport Blvd. The Relationship Banker Esthelin was so helpful and friendly. She answered some questions that I had and she helped me take care of some banking business.

I was greeted when I walked in the door and the person asked what they could help me with. This Bank of America is now my home bank. I will be recommending this Bank to my sister who has banked with Bank of America for more than 40 years.I really love my local bank - this location on Airport Blvd here in Austin. I live just a few minutes away, and EVERY TIME I need help, the customer service is outstanding.

I maintain my business checking account here, and chose BoA and this location because they were welcoming and helpful the whole way through. Every time I have to go to the physical location or call them on the phone, they have consistently been friendly, welcoming and professional problem solvers and stress reducers! My business includes international clients, and they and customer service were so helpful in making sure I had everything I need to manage the payment piece flawlessly.

I highly recommend this branch!Drive thru always closed. I’m 5 1/2 months pregnant and they refused to let me use the bathroom. Really

UPDATE!!! ***** I was followed by someone at this bank yesterday all the way to north Austin and my car was broken into. According to the bank, this has been happening often. The bank has zero security and they are very indiscreet when giving cash.  There are no signs warning customers that this has become a common occurrence and to beware!I had a very good experiences at this boa ranch. For now, I have been working with 3 staff there for several times, and they are all professional, patient and friendly to me. I come here for their good service even though this is not the nearest location for me.It was 1st time I went into bank since Covid. Banker Daniela Rodriguez was very nice and helpful, I needed to get my name changed and she was able to assist me right away and quickly help me out. The bank wasn’t busy at the time I’m there and everyone is very nice.Do not withdraw money from your account at this location, people are waiting in the parking lot to follow you and rob you.  Be Aware !!!! When I called the bank, they said it is a common occurrence.I can never reach anyone by phone at this location no matter when I call! Customer service has drastically deteriorated over the years and I'm extremely disappointed!The hours at this location are not suitable for business customers in the morning or afternoon. No drive through either.","Positives:

My employer pay checks are through chase bank and I can’t cash my check with this recent policy change. I’ve been coming here for a while now and used to not have any issues but now all the sudden it’s an issue. Why change a policy when it’s going screw over your guests and loyal customers. Absolutely ridiculous. If your checks are through chase or a different bank do not come here.We experience a great customer service specially from Victor Ayoola. The staff here is very professional. Thanks for assisting us on our new checking account.The teller was very rude to us today! I met the same teller many times before and she was always very nice. However, when she was busy and she can be very impatient. Please be patient with your customers. We will never go back that location again.I’ve been stuck with a BOA auto loan for 4 years now and their service has been in decline. It gets worse every year and their app/online features literally make it difficult to pay your bill sometimes cause late fees. How convenient. I’m never opening another account with this soulless company. It’s really a shame they took the name “bank of America” because they are the least American company I’ve done business with. Stay local my friends.Great department which I admire for helpfulness, politeness and being customer-centric. I tried others which were closer to my location but really prefer to do extra miles and time to be in the right place.
Management is totally up to the clients and tries to come through every case effectively.Staff are rude and always30-40 mins delay..Never wait long.

94,Bank of America,"12400 State Hwy 71 Bldg F, Bee Cave, TX 78738",Austin,"This week I took my son to the Bee Cave branch to open his first checking account.  I had forgotten to make an appointment, but we were still taken into an office right away.  Pam did a great job setting up the account.  Antonio also assisted and they were both incredibly friendly and helpful.   I have been to this branch about 5 times and have always had quick, friendly service.It has been 40 years since I opened an account in Bank of America at Houston, and I have always felt that it is smooth and convenient. However, I have rarely entered the bank in recent years. Today I went to this bank wondering to apply for many affairs, and it was handled by the financial center manager Christina Clynes. I and my wife together asked for debit card regeneration, apply for credit supplementary cards, print new checkbooks, and withdraw cash of various currencies, although our English is not smooth, the manager is very patient and responsible to answer all questions in detail throughout the process, ensuring customers The security of our account is guaranteed, and we are very touched by her professionalism. Bank of America's excellent service to customers makes me proud of owning their accounts so far. I write this to express our high respect for the hard service will of these wonderful employees!The WORST bank ever! Every visit to this branch ends up an hour wait just for something simple, like depositing a dang check. They always have ONE EMPLOYEE working as a teller no matter how long you've been standing there. You'd think they'd hire more than one person to do this sort of job, right? Also, there is no drive-thru!walked into this branch today to ask about putting a stop on checks for an existing account. quickly sat with ms. clynes, who explained options and helped me set account alerts to avoid a stop check fee. greatly appreciate her efficiency and assistance!Because of the close location, I use this ATM all the time and it works great.  However, have never been inside when they could actually help ( getting things notarized, changing names on my account, filling out paperwork on a government form etc.).  Therefore I drive several miles to another BOA branch or use the Wells Fargo down the street for any sort of in-person customer service needs.Awful customer experience really making me consider switching my accounts to another bankUtterly miserable service today.

university federal credit union, here I come.Wish they were open longer hours but it is what it is.    As a business owner I get hard curve balls sent my way sometimes.   Lise was able to get me some paperwork done that normally takes a while to get done and was able to save the day.   Thank you so much!I really liked the way they helped me, very kind and the location looks new! Also the fact that it’s open until 5pm.Needed to update my legal info for months (name and address changes) and an appointment was finally made for me at this location. Bank of America's own HQ, customer service, website, and appointment booker all went through with this. Since they're open 10-4, I took time off work to get this legal paperwork done and somehow at no point in this process did anything or anyone tell me this place was closed. Glad I don't need to fill out my paperwork anymore; I can't waste my time again if I just quit using this bank.Really friendly and helpful.

BOA unfortunately has gotten so bad these past few years. I’m really considering switching. Between the overdraft fees for going over $5 is ridiculous. They are greedy and don’t care about their customers anymore.This branch has been closed for over a year. Not sure why it's listed as open.I waited for about 30 minutes, the line was nearly out the door and they had a single teller moving at the pace of a sloth.This branch is long past due for renovations long since the tornado hit the area  when will it be openGreat customer service.

96,Bank of America,"8627 Research Blvd, Austin, TX 78758",Austin,"I'm not sure if it's because this location is under staffed, or we are keeping payroll for people doing one on one meetings, but this was sad. I had to leave and come back twice this week, because the lines are crazy.  They have a business window with no teller, just one teller working on a line of 16 people. Can we do better @Bank of America??? This makes me want to close my accounts, because basic level of customer service is attending to those in house, and we are not meeting those standards.I needed to update my account information and make a withdrawal. I arrived about 20 minutes before closing and waited in line for 15 minutes. After making my withdrawal I was told that I needed to wait in the back to speak with someone at the kiosk to update the name on the account. I stood there waiting another 10 minutes because the lady working the kiosk walked off just before I headed to the back. After about 10 minutes or so, the lady came across the corner as I decided to sit down and very aggressively said “ma’am’ what are you doing here? We are closed”. I told her I was told to wait here to have my account info updated and I was instructed to wait here. she’s like “we are closed you need to leave”. I asked her why and she stated that their closed and she can’t make the employees wait how long to help you. Interestingly enough there was another lady waiting at the kiosk as well and she chose to help her but sent me away. Matter of fact she helped everyone who appeared to be of Hispanic descent. All of whom arrived before closing just as I did.

I later called customer service and spoke with a rep named Mandy to file a formal complaint. I explained everything that happened and she was able to simply put in a request to have my name on my account corrected. I don’t know why I couldn’t get this help before and was constantly sent into a banking center to be treated like a criminal. I could go into a whole longer story if needing a $50k cashiers check to buy a car and the two hours I waited because of course they thought I was trying to steal but that’s already in a different review.

At this time I’m going to start the process of terminating my relationship with Bank of America.Worst bank of America location ever.. Never opens on time. Ever. And never has enough staff to get the long line handled.My business partner and I came to Bank of America to open a new business account. We were first attended by this nice clerk who guided us on how to go about getting an appointment.

I can't be more impressed with the short-wait time, compared to the business of the institution.  I would like to give a shout-out to two superstars, Brenda who helped me open an account, and this other guy (can't remember his name) who helped add-on my business partner to the account. Very happy with their service, and I look forward to connecting soon for whatever banking needs my new company @JJ's Photo Studio & Marketing. LLC goes. Thank you, Brenda and the other gentleman. (He usually wears a long brown/black coat. 😉😊😇so did balance assist 1 time paid back early now can no longer get it. was supposed to have 6 a year. pretty bad treating customers like that. thinking you can get emergency funds then saying no.I coming appointment my like 3 o’clock I wait like two hours she say can you can wait like 20 minutes after this I wait like two hour and 5 o’clock he told you it is closing you can go now you can come back tomorrow. The manager is no good I’m asking for a big manager make understand as manager because my job is starting like 4 o’clock one hour. I’m late for my work because the manager she is no good he talk no good he show me like attitude he never see can you just wait I like this one he just took my name and he said just wait here because this is no good I never come no more of this bank he doesn’t like him goodbye😡Worst service ever! Only one teller inside, with a log line in the lobby. Other employees walking around, trying to look important. Don't they realize the clients are who keep them employed?The slowest customer service I've ever seen. And they only had two employees working the window on a Friday afternoon. Also this is a lobby only location.I wish I could give them zero, when you want to withdraw/taking a cash, there is no privacy, everyone can see you taking the cash and it’s putting your life at risk.
Plus if you need to see an associate, than you have to wait 2 plus hours.
I will close my account with BFA.Their service is too much slow here is Hague line of people just one counter is taking care of customers remaining 5 to six counter is no body there I don’t know what is going on with Bank of AmericaAlways understaffed. Lines are always long and they take forever.Worst experience I’ve ever had, and the worst staff. Couldn’t get help from anyone. Just cost me a lot of money sitting here for two hours with no help. I will never use this bank again. Don’t even deserve a starThey have to put teller on behavioral course. They are rude and believe they are doing favor to us to serve us. This is really bad.Lines are so long all the time.Service they offer is not good at allThere's always a line outside . Always ..Very bad servicesWonderful helpful staffOne hour waiting in lineCustomers service is troubleThe bad service, and the lack of professionalism is what is fashionable in this branch, they should close it, or look for people who want to work and have better customer service, every day they tarnish the image of Banco América more, not to mention the bad treatment among Latinos when we went there. We went to look for a document that did not need to be notarized, it was simple and we have been waiting 3 weeks for said paper and when we called no one answered the phone, and the only time they answered with bad form and even offending and advising that we would not call because we were bothering them. That bank is a shame.5 windows and only one working, the line is too slow, the worst branch I have ever visited.BAD ATTENTION","Positives:

97,Bank of America,"3900 Interregional Hwy, Austin, TX 78751",Austin,"This location seems understaff, however the times that I’ve visit I noticed that the employees really are trying their best. They are polite, and very professional. The manager is always running around greeting everyone. Bank of America needs more employees at this location.Been going to this bank branch for about a year.  Although it is usually busy, the staff there are universally helpful and very friendly despite being obviously understaffed.   I think the old reviews must have been when there  were different tellers and bankers.  The current group is fantastic!Par for the course. Every interaction so far with BoA has been the worst.

I dont bank with them, and I dont understand why anyone does.Location hours are a joke from 10 am -4 pm. Bank of America, here is an idea- how about you make banking hours at a time when people don’t have to take time off work just to do ordinary tasks. Either open up earlier or stay open later.I really don’t know why I bank here anymore. One teller working and a line of six people deep. It’s always a terrible experience.I suggest to just shut this bank down. I decided to open another account with another bank. It's much better. I'll eventually close BOA account soon. Banking has gone from Great years ago to Poor the last couple of years. Covid is not the reason. I have a business and don't use excuses.This Bank is the worst BOA I have ever been to, no wonder they have 2star, I am not from the area & just stopped here very unprofessional managerEveryone is so helpful especially Yazmin.
Thank you for being open again!I recommend Wells Fargo. They will treat you better than this place. Maybe it was just this location.This location has no one literally ever working it. Always closed and cannot access lobby when they are open.And they have been very helpful to me.BankingEUNICE HELPED ME IN 1 MINUTE

98,Bank of America,"701 E Stassney Ln Bldg F, Austin, TX 78745",Austin,"If I could give it zero I would! Every time I come it is longer than 30 minutes and that's being nice on the time. It's ridiculous that all the surrounding banks are closed on Saturdays and this one is left with one or two people helping. Get more people! Open more locations. Obviously people work during business hours of the week and the line out the door all day should tell you this. Pay your employees more to be here on weekends-you clearly have the clientele for it.Ms.Cáceres was very sweet to me, it was my first time their and they made me feel like I wasn’t being judged everyone is so respectful and sweet. The one who helped me explained to everything to me step my step☺️ she did an amazing job I recommend going to her if you need anything!.I could not possibly hate this place more. Every time (daily) I even try to use to ATM, some dopey security guard is blocking the way for someone that spends HOURS doing maintenance. The ATM’s hardly work. The employees have no sense of urgency. It feels intentionally slow, and they are so unprofessional. There are endless lines to use ANYTHING. You’d save yourself time and inconvenience going to any other location. This place is hell on earth.The WORST staffed and customer experience. After waiting 45 min in the business line, told I could not go in the personal line, the teller told me she needed to leave. As I then waited foe the next teller, the first teller then proceeds to help the person behind me. When the new teller opened up, she ignored me,as I was in the business line. Left after an hour, no service. Very much looking forward to changing banks for my business.Very very slow people I ever seen in this bank the supervisor should take care of these employeesI was at the lobby the ladies were very nice but they were misleading with lies, tried to open a checking account for my 13 year old son and they told me that my son needed to be present and that was the lie. I open it in another branch.This bank has horrible customer service soon as I walk in Noone was at service Desk for about 15 min then a woman with long hair comes telling me it will be about a hr and 30 min wait meanwhile one gentleman tells her I'm going to take my lunch while there are 3 customers waiting to speak to him he was a banker he sees customers waiting and he ignores us a goes to lunch he is supposed to take care of customers 1st . Then after he left there was another man wearing a tuxedo just watching as more people enter the bank he was waiting in middle office .meanwhile the teller lines are flying there was a total of 10 of us waiting some of the tellers could have helped assist us. Finally after waiting 1hr and 10 min another woman with a bun and heels asked me if I needed help I told her yes she called a woman from behind tellers desk to help me out why couldn't she have asked them soon as I walked in so she asks me to go to a desk she tells me someone will be right with me another 15 min pass by multiple employees walk past me not helping me one was talking about the computer is taking long to load due to Netflix.  Why are employees on Netflix this is ridiculous I got up and left such a wast of my time.  This bank is horrible everyone working here has horrible customer service no reason it should take so long when there are multiple employees walking around doing absolutely nothing. A bank is supposed to be in and out this is a sorry excuse for a bank very unprofessional environment I will never walk into this bank ever again.I didn’t think a bank could get a real low rating, but it’s bad. There is 1 teller and about 15-20 clients waiting. Not moving. A lady ahead of me said she had already been waiting 30 minsWarning this customer service rep/manager by the name of Maritza Hernandez A person at the front desk,  after confirming they were going to give me money from my account. She informed me that they don’t have to do anything and if I didn’t be quite because I didn’t understand their policy she was going to cancel my transaction. But after telling me to shut up I decided to stand up for my self and any customers who didn’t understand their policy. And for this reason was told to leave by from what was observed was a dictator manager.This was one of the best banking experiences I have had. Every staff member was accommodating and personable. It was a very busy day and the line started outside the building but they were moving very quickly to help everyone and I didn't have to wait longer than 10 minutes. Highly recommend.I would give them zero stars if it were an option! Never any tellers but always seem to have 3 lady’s walking around in the lobby with an IPad. It’s a very normal occurrence to have to wait 30-45 min before you can get anyone to help you! TERRIBLE!!There the worsts Bank here in Austin there the slowest tellers ever and there representatives are the worst to greet people they need to hire different people and make it professional again it's awful I've been to others Bank Of America and this is the worst one in Stassney Lane in Austin 78745TexasThis place NEVER picks up their phones.  Tried 10 times over 3 days.  What a poorly run bank.  Wanted to open an account and now Wells Fargo has a new customer! :)Reduced banking hours and staff has made it a nightmare to see a banker regarding anything; especially even with an appointment. Last time I tried to see a banker, I waited an hour and twenty minutes!!! Unacceptable!!!Zero stars !
Zero attention
Zero care
100 liar and abusive.Went to the bank today it was quite a wait but I waited an hour and 30 minutes which was fine with me because I didn’t schedule appointment after I waited I had the worst bank teller ever she was so rude definitely would never recommend her she was so awful She slammed my paper on the desk and was like you’re finished I swear people need better customer serviceWorst location I've ever had the misfortune of using. Every time there are multiple ATMs out of service, rude and unhelpful staff.Been bank there since I moved to Austin in 2000 never any issues. With great customer service.Was not surprised when I came to check reviews after my check could not be cashed by a teller and I was told to wait.TerribleGood experience the ATM actually workedAwfulTerrible","Positives:

99,Bank of America,"9912 Menchaca Rd, Austin, TX 78748",Austin,"I went to this bank for an issue with my account.  They were so helpful and professional.  All my questions were answered and I felt very reassured that all my issues would be corrected.Customer service really lousy - they give me attitude when making deposits. Find another job if your not happyTried to do a deposit, and the manager was the rudest. I understand a transaction not being able to be done, but I don’t understand nor tolerate when being mistreated and being asked questions as if I were a criminal. She could definitively learn some new people skills.Priscilla was fast and prompt and addressed my needs with attention to detail. I really appreciate you!They closed the drive thru permanently and don’t open until a later time of 10 AM. The teller is very nice. I’m unhappy with the technicals of BOA. I need a bank that is convenient for me. Other banks still have their drive thrus open and have better hours. Strongly considering switching to another bank.Never open I use to like coming to this bank since it’s near my house but yeah no now it just never opensBillion dollar business yet only 1 teller; no regard for people's time. They charge you money to cash a check instead of charging the company paying you through them (obviously more profitable to take the money from the poor). Crooks.When you call they have no 'hold' option.  I need to talk to an agent. I called over 30 times, maybe over 40. Everytime, I was told ""everyone is assistanting costumers."" Ok, so put me on hold and get to me when someone is free. Why insist on being the only company without a hold option? So the only way to talk to someone is to go there in person. Meeting over the phone should be an option any day they are open, but it should especially be an option during a pandemic. I have been with this branch for over a decade, but I think this is finally the nudge I been needing to join a local credit union and be done with BoA.Woah! Why are the reviews so low?? I am always so satisfied with the service here. Leticia is amazing and always watching out for my mother and I. By the book.Incredibly slow service ans apathetic staff.

100,Frost Bank,"734 Northwest Loop 410, San Antonio, TX 78216",San Antonio,"This is the worst bank I’ve ever had!!!

They go thru a nightly maintenance where you cannot JUST log into your app, but you cannot access your funds. I go out and go to bars and at the end of the night my card got declined even though I have the funds, and when I call frost to see what’s going on their excuse is “we are going thru Maintenance so we cannot verify your account” it’s been TWICE in the last week that I’ve been left embarrassed and having to have someone else pay my tab cause FROST can’t get it together.

No problems, she just wanted to make sure everything was running smoothly and wanted to answer any questions that I might have had. If that doesn't spell out GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE, I don't know what else does.

Side note: I would definitely recommend this location over the branch on Vance Jackson. It makes a HUGE difference.One of the last banks on Earth that don't charge you to cash your customer's checks unlike the other communist Banks that want a ridiculous check cashing fee.I never have any issues when I use Frost Bank. This little branch is always within reach and the staff are incredibly quick and friendly. Today another customer was incredibly incredulous, but the teller kept her cool and continued to assist the man with a smile.
Bonus, they always have cookies!I am still confused about that . This is a bank.
Very bad experience I have there the lady laying me I have recorded everything I asked 😭 I show it to manager he has no work I left over the room …Jadah on the commercial window is never friendly nor ever smiles .  Doesn’t greet when you arrive.  I have been at this location to make a  commercial deposit several times and I always receive this treatment.  She definitely needs to work on her communication skills .This Frost bank location is nice, clean, and staff are smiling, greeting customers, friendly, and courteous. Always someone there to help out the customer(s).A more or less good bank, but in my particular point of view, a bit complicated with its procedures, I agree with its privacy policy and its distrust, but what I did not think was that they treat you in a bad way, what would be appreciated would be a bit of kindness and an explanation in a good way and not in a bad way on the part of the staff who work there very badly in that aspect. in general everything is goodExcellent service 👍","Positives:

Upper Management needs to address this issue.Frost bank is your go to Texas bank, they still feel like a bank, what do I mean? Walk in most banks and you are looking at a Mac machine, oh excuse me an ATM, money access center for the youngins, that didn’t live before computers. Banks with tellers and loan officers and desks with plants, one of the coolest places back in time was going to a bank, lol because that’s where you get money to start a business, get a house or a car, everything was more special, interesting and yes fun, I hope Frost survives the economic crash coming to a theater near you! I have a feeling on the other side, we are going back to the way some things were, dress for success!I really like Karla at the Culebra branch.  We greet on first name basis which makes me feel special.  I prefer walking into the lobby cause the drive thru tends to stay busy.  I have to drive aways but this location has been my home branch for over 20 years.

I must honestly say they are very  sincere in thier interest in my personal account.

105,Frost Bank,"12607 Blanco Rd, San Antonio, TX 78216",San Antonio,"Frost employees are always professional and courteous. I agree the building layout is somewhat odd on how you must enter/exit but I put it in perspective unlike others. As for the bank and its services/products, banking is highly federally & state compliance driven which equates to cost that must be passed on to the consumer. This is true to all businesses but its how they manage these costs within their allotted budgets on their financial health and ultimate future. I know of other local CU's or banks in San Antonio area that do provide lower fees depending on the product but its a balancing act across the board and remember............you get what you pay for.Horrible customer service. Not a relationship bank at all. Doesn’t matter how long you’ve been with them or how much money you have with them. They still don’t treat you with respect here.

Today we called over to see about Notary services and we’re told to come.  We took time off work to go but they don’t notarize legal documents because of liability.  It would have been super helpful to have known this before driving down.Today 6-6-22, I was slandered by Bank Manager: Annette, Almost 10 yrs ago my brother and I were in business, one morning I walked into the lobby, there to greet me was Annette, she stated my brother was in the (drive thru) and got out of his truck, and throw his chest at the teller? I ask to see the video tape, she got very up set, and told me she was going to close out our account. I told her I had no idea of this. I gave her examples of a relationship just because you get into a argument with your husband is no grounds for a speration. I also told her, what happened to the policy of the customer is always right, it fell on the floor, 6 yrs later I asked her where are the employees that accused my brother... They left the bank, she stated, and am still here as a loyal customer! Today she told a bank manager that i had a bad reputation which is a fraudulent statement, hurting my character.

But because i can't easily transfer money to another account, this was a showstopper.  At Randolph Brooks, I can do a member to member cash transfer using just a phone number.  The bad customer experience really started when i tried depositing cash to a family member's account, and the tellers refused to give me $10 change.  Just flat out refused.  I even told them very clearly, that's absurd.  They seemed extra happy to give me my money and ID back. They used to be so helpful and courteous. After today's bad teller experience at frost, glad I'm not a frost customer anymore,So many times when we have a bad experience, we are quick to share that situation, and as we should and can. I'd like to share an awesome experience with you, I had a few issues going on with my accounts, that I just knew I needed to speak with a manager. I went to the Frost Bank 515 S.W.

Also would like to add that I have had a personal and business accounts for over 20 plus years, and by far Frost Bank is hands down the best banking experience ever.  I can't do this without mentioning their phone customer service,  it is local as opposed being outsourced to another country(the issue being dialect,and both parties understanding each other). For those supreme reasons everything about Frost Bank says Texas, and thank you.I went in to open up two secure loans. One for my personal and one for my business. I had all of my paperwork ready.

110,Frost Bank,"111 W Houston St Suite 100, San Antonio, TX 78205",San Antonio,"These are some of the photos I took while installing unitized glass panels at the Frost Tower building, not one single panel was broken during installation and a record setting of 65 panels were set in a 10 hour work shift by Arrowall glass company fr. Dec. 27,2017 - Mar. 7, 2019Fantastic experience here! I had to exchange USD for Euros for a trip I am taking soon and was thinking it might be a slight hassle to do so but pleasantly found out I was wrong. I was seen very quickly and given very professional and helpful service. I was also very pleased by the fact that even though I had arrived in shirts and a t-shirt, I was still treated with importance and respect. Awesome experience and I will definitely come back to this location if I need to exchange more money in the future.I needed some pesos for my next trip to Mexico. Came down to my local Frost bank financial center. I was taken care of fast and was treated with 5-star customer service. I am proud to bank with frost!!!Wow! I have never had such amazing customer service at a bank before. Samantha and Kaila were just incredible! Unicorns! They are knowledgeable problem solvers.  I have been dreading opening a joint account because banks typically take so long. As soon as I walked in they made everything CRAZY easy and fast. They even got my app up and running, helped me update my zelle account, the list goes on. I am just blown away by their delightful attitude and level of customer service. Above and beyond for sure! I am transferring my other accounts to Frost bank because of my experience. Thank you Samantha and Kaila!!Fresh architectural addition to the San Antonio downtown skyline.Been helped

Great greeters plus attending in the area of bank tellers
Give you 5 star rate in the best service for meAs an update years since my original post, my opinion hasn't changed.  Even with all the improvements made to the adjoining land and the restoration to the creek, the Frost Tower is still an affront to our history.  We are not flashy and weird Austin, we aren't the glamour of Dallas or the oil of Houston, San Antonio is the old wealth that matters. The wealth of great history and culture!  Our culture, our people, and our city reflect that, we shouldn't hide it with flashy glass towers that simply reflect for the sake of reflecting.   And that is all the Frost Tower does, and it doesn't even do that well. It's as if it was purposely designed to clash with and make a mockery of San Antonio's unique personality and style.  The tower it replaced wasn't so, it fit in with the city, it didn't try to be pretentious.  Instead of complimenting and continuing the historic and timeless Spanish and German influences that define the look of Downtown, this newer towers' dark tinted glass and sharp geometry are so out of place it appears alien in nature.  Frost could have, should have given San Antonio, the home of Frost, something that understood our history, that respected our history, instead we got a misplaced, squat, imperfect facsimile of the Frost Tower in Austin.  It's such a shame too, the Austin tower is perfect for Austin and the culture of that city, we deserved the same amount of thought and respect in the design of our tower.As a Collective I believe the entire city of San Antonio is Proud to have this beautiful and modern skyscraper added to our skyline.Beautiful building personal is very professional and helpfulFrost Bank used to be the top rated bank in San Antonio.  I would not recommend them these days.  I was earning .05% on my checking accounted 2 years ago.  Wow! Lol.  Granted, that's nothing. A year ago it dropped to .03%.  This year it's at .01%. pathetic!! What's the incentive to have a checking account at Frost? No, I'm not one wjho just has the mimimum to keep the account open.
I bet I can take the money out and deposit it elsewhere and do lots better.
Frost built there new tower to try to help define our downtown skyline. The city wanted someone to help define our skyline. I bet both the city and Frost went in together on the cost. It's a nice building, but   around the time they anounced the building of a new headquarters, the interest rate on my checking account began to nosedive. Hmmm!  You got millions to build a swank headquarters but screw the checking account holders. If it wasn't for our accounts, you wouldn't be in business.
So I give them 1 star based on that.
I'm not saying the upper crust at Frost Bsnk are a bunch of dummies.  I'm saying they are screwing the customers in checking interest earned.  They must think account holders are stupid and/or uneducated.  Pretty sky move on Frost's part.
11-30-21
Why has Frost Bank spent so much money on a new tower? Sure it's nice and adds to the skyline and the city bigwigs love it. Did the city help with the cost. It sure hasn't benefited their customers. .01%  interest is pitiful.  Having just around $12,850 in their bank and I make about $1.20 a year. Yes that's 1 dollar and 20 cents. What's the incentive to bank at Frost. Yes, $12,850 is small in the scheme of things but, why put more in Frost.  CD's are not paying well either. Dies Frost not invest well and therefore can't offer better return on money.

111,Frost Bank,"11555 Bandera Rd, San Antonio, TX 78250",San Antonio,"I went to refinance a home equity loan,  We were never able to speak to a live person. Even when we went to the bank lobby we told we had to complete it online. So much for a being a friendly place.  Once we started the only communication was by email. So someone named Tatiana  started the process off by emailing us stating she had no direct line so email was only communication.  Frost bank had us doing all the work with little or no direction. All we received were rude and condescending emails when we would ask a question. This went on for 5 weeks
before we decided to try Broadway Bank,  We met with a live person at the Helotes branch. Fantastic service loan was completed in 3 weeks.  We will be switching banks at end of May 2023.  Frost Bank is not the same bank it was in the past. Terrible service.HORRIBLE SERVICE HORRIBLE BANK! If your thinking of switching to this bank DO NOT they give you last min deadlines NOT WORTH IT! If I could leave ZERO STARS I ABSOLUTELY WOULDI'm not sure if she's the branch manager, most likely since she had the audacity to be so short and unfriendly for no reason. Went in with my grandmother to help her pick up a new card and just let them know we went through the app and it gave us the option to pick it up at the branch location. She glared at me saying with an attitude even though you go through the app we won't have it ready so you'll have to wait because we don't pre print them. Lady, I wasnt saying it should be ready right this second, just letting you know what we did in case you needed to know. Don't be so quick to be rude to people who keep their money at your location. You count money, humble yourself.I walked in with cash in hand to set up a secondary bank account to be used for rent transactions. The woman at the front desk was unfriendly and gave very little explanation as to the types of checking accounts they offer or any other options. I explained this account would be secondary for me until I was ready to switch from my current bank. She told me that if I did not plan to use their bank as a primary account, they would terminate the relationship because they are a relationship driven bank. I happily walked out and drove down the road to Broadway Bank where the relationship bankers went above and beyond to help me set up an account even though the lobby was closing within 5 minutes of our arrival, and stayed late to help me set up the app.The drive thru is so easy and convenient when I have multiple accounts to put check's in when Derek is working. We give him 5 star's.Horrible bank . Wouldn’t recommend: they steal your money and leave you high in dry. Disrespectful agents and supervisors! Go to a credit union!

Approximately once a month, we have a fundraiser where we go to Costco, Sam’s, or H-E-B to buy items. 90% of the time that I try to use my card I get a decline for some sort of security reason even though there is plenty of money in the account. This last visit at Costco, I tried my pin once and it was declined, and then I tried to bypass the pin and use it as a credit card. It was declined again. I ended up using my personal Prosperity bank card, which always seems to work fine. When I called up Frost bank, they said I was locked out, because I tried my pin too many times even though I only tried it once. Furthermore, it locked me out of the Online app and they said that takes 24 hours to reset.

116,Frost Bank,"18762 Stone Oak Pkwy, San Antonio, TX 78258",San Antonio,"I went to the Stone Oak branch on Wednesday June 7, the customer service was so great, EVERYONE was friendly and it didn’t go unnoticed.
The young lady who helped my at the teller window fixed my issue, answered my questions and made the transaction effortless and quick.
The young man next to her was blessed with an ederly customer who chatted and chatted and he never lost patience with her and he was so sweet to her.
I loved that they were so sweet to her.
Last month, I went to another branch after someone stole my bank information and they took care of everything and were so patient with me while they changed all my info safely to another account. They returned the stolen money as well.
Frost Bank has great customer service.
I’ve been a customer for about 20 years now.Everyone is super nice here. Loved that they exchange foreign currency for both members (no fee) and non-members ($5 fee).I am a huge proponent of Frost banking so it’s with much heartache that I write this post however I feel it necessary so that it may be corrected.

A few minutes ago FRIDAY, 3:40 PM to be exact I walked into the lobby of this branch to inquire  about opening a business checking account.

Like most frost banks, if not all ,I was very pleased with the customer service just from the parking lot into the door. I was greeted by a young man who opened and held the door for me (he had fabulous eyebrows I must add). He was dressed professionally slacks and a navy blue coat. Walking into a frost bank you can’t help but to be taken back by the amount of detail in every corner of the construction of their buildings. However when I approached the front desk and I’m not referring to the tellers, I had to literally ask for assistance because Miss Belinda Galvan seemed preoccupied and annoyed. I could see that her attitude was one I surely could care less to engage with so I ask her if I should set an appointment. she reluctantly answered that she could find a room for us. Her demeanor was one of arrogance and pretentious. I apologize I’m not sure what kind of afternoon or day she may be having but I’m not in customer service and I know if there is a new customer they deserve at least your undivided attention and a smile.

Neither which were given. Seeing as we were both wearing masks I still could tell that this woman couldn’t smile with her eyes if They paid her to, which they do.

Let me just state that sadly this single experience is why I decided to go down the street and open with Wells Fargo.","Positives:

I was called by a random branch manager to stop by my nearest branch so my husband could show ID for a check I had deposited on the app into my sole account. As someone who has worked as a bank teller for many years I understood how completely normal this was. I just had a baby and also have a toddler so I figured this was something we could do at the drive thru. Went to the drive thru, the teller stated how unnormal that was and that we needed to come inside to speak to a banker, I explained to her that we had a newborn and toddler in the car with us so if she could speak to a banker and see if they could help us at the drive thru. She didn't bother asking instead told me they couldn't because the equipment the bankers uses can't be moved. I was confused at what she meant so I agreed to come inside. Luke Martinez is the banker that helped me and when I saw his ""equipment"" was a laptop I asked him why it is that he wouldn't have been able to help me at the drive thru as a courtesy since he worked on a laptop and he decided to double down and say that the he could only work from the lobby. Which doesn't make sense, the company issues you a laptop for a reason. I've banked with frost for 15 years and I've never been disappointed by them. It was a first that they missed the mark to go above and beyond for a member, something I have been used to all these years, in order to handle a simple issue through the drive thru and show knowledge to a simple situation. The teller definitely needs to be retrained and Luke needs to show he cares enough to help members who are new moms with newborns. His laptop is portable and he could have definitely helped me in the drive thru.I’m an independent locksmith, I came into this location with a check for $185 a customer gave me months prior for cutting and programming her car key, when I try cashing in the check the clerk is hesitating to complete the transaction, after a few awkward minutes of typing in her computer she tells me she cannot cash the check because it is made out to locksmith, I explain to her the situation and ask her to please call and verify with the customer, she agrees and tells me to wait in the seating area. Twenty minutes later she comes out gripping the check telling me she cannot cash it and will not be returning the check, I ask if we can call the customer together to straiten everything out and she refused. At no point does the clerk try to verify or let me prove that this check was made out to me (mind you I have my locksmith license on me and photo receipt of the transaction) but instead just keeps the money that I worked for and tries to rush me out the door saying “just get another check”. I’m extremely disappointed in how this was handled and am livid that my hard earned money was stolen from me. I suppose if you bank here don’t worry about giving checks out like candy, they probably won’t be able to be cashed.I had a great first experience opening an account.","Positives:

123,Frost Bank,"9090 Fair Oaks Pkwy, Fair Oaks, TX 78015",San Antonio,"Service fell off a cliff.  Been banking here for 20+ years and used to like them.  Went in to access my safety deposit box which I've also had at this location for 20 years only to find after 15 minutes waiting around that I no longer have access to it.  I'm the primary account holder.  Not only did I not have access to it, they also wouldn't tell me who did.  Fortunately, my wife was with me, and she still had access.  When we added another family member to the box access a few months back, they dropped me off.  To be given my access back, I had to cancel out this box and rent another box.  This sounds like a red tape addled government bureaucracy, not a privately owned, supposedly customer-oriented business.  I ended up cleaning out the box and terminating the rental.  As soon as I get some direct deposits moved, I'll be closing out all other accounts and will no longer do business with Frost bank.
Other dropped services include no more notary public service, and unresponsive investment counselors that never return phone calls.","Positives:
- No personal names mentioned in the reviews
- Customer has been banking at the branch for over 20 years
- Customer used to like the bank
- Branch has safety deposit box service
- Customer's wife still had access to the safety deposit box
- Customer was able to cancel the rental and terminate the agreement
- Branch offers investment counseling services

Room for Improvement:
- Service quality has declined
- Customer lost access to their safety deposit box without explanation
- Lack of transparency regarding who has access to the safety deposit box
- Inconvenience of having to cancel and rent a new safety deposit box
- Comparing the experience to a government bureaucracy is a negative implication
- No provision of notary public service
- Investment counselors are unresponsive and do not return phone calls

Miscellaneous:
- Customer plans to close all other accounts and discontinue business with Frost bank
- Direct deposits need to be moved before closing accounts"
124,Frost Bank,"16895 I-35 N, Schertz, TX 78154",San Antonio,Made the switch to Frost Bank and so glad I did! I'm not just a number at Frost Bank. And Ms. Gonzales (Blanco Road Branch) went above and beyond to help me set up an Estate Account for my father who recently passed away. And of course they are pup friendly too. Oh and no wait for my debit card they printed it right there in the lobby! I'm really glad I made the switch!I had an excellent experience at Frost yesterday with Chris! He was very knowledgeable and professional. He also let us know about possible future banking possibilities with Frost. We will definitely continue to bank with Frost as opposed to other banks near by! Thank you Chris!Was the only person in line teller was busy she didn't acknowledge I was there. I waited like I was supposed to teller then calls the other person that walked in after me and didn't ask who was first. A little better customer training goes a lo g way. I have never had an issue with this branch until today.Very attentive and helpfulGoodLove this bank,"Positives:

125,Wells Fargo Bank,"823 NE Interstate 410 Loop, San Antonio, TX 78209",San Antonio,"Absolute worst branch I’ve ever been in for any bank. Chase, RBFCU, Frost, Citi would never treat their customers as horribly as Wells has. Initially my complaint was for the bank as a whole, not a branch, but after being at this branch? None of the tellers or branch manager had manners, one personal banker was busy with someone so I can’t discredit her. But none of their employees (at this branch) even understand kindness or empathy.HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. TRIED TO DO A TRANSACTION IN THE DRIVE THRU. WAS UNABLE TO COMPLETE IT. WAS UNAWARE I LEFT MY LICENSE WITH TELLER AND I RECEIVED MULTIPLE CALLS FROM THE BRANCH. WHEN I GOT BACK TO PICK UP MY LICENSE I WAS TOLD BY A SUPERVISOR I HAD TO PRODUCE SOME SORT OF IDENTIFICATION FOR HER TO RELEASE IT BACK TO ME. WHAT SENSE DID THAT MAKE? WHO COMES TO THE BANK AND SAY I FORGOT MY LICENSE? I REALLY FEEL LIKE IT WAS RACIAL PROFILING. YOU ARE LOOKING AT ME BUT TELLING ME YOU NEEDED SOMETHING ELSE TO VERIFY IT WAS ME. THE SAME TRANSACTION I TRIED TO COMPLETE EARLIER AND WAS TOLD THEY COULD NOT DO IT SHE THEN ASKED ME IF I WANTED TO COMPLETE IT. I TOLD HER NO AND DROVE OFF. SMHAbsolute worst. They deleted my direct deposit of thousands of dollars and this caused overdraft acct and drained the acct to nothing. Called customer service and was on hold 30 minutes, then finally someone, who you can’t understand, says they are going to transfer you again and then the line hangs up.

Says a “technical issue” on the website but I guess “technically” I’ll just not pay my mortgage or buy food for my family until this is figured out. Wells Fargo sucks as soon as this is cleared I’m storing my cash in my mattress.Had a bad and rude experience with this location. I was told I couldn't make a cash deposit, for whatever reason. The lady did not have her name tag on so I didn't get it but she was rude and didn't explain to me on why I couldn't make a cash depotStopped by at 11 am it Took 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge me the personal banker  was to busy making copies. Waited 10 minutes for her to tell me there are no personal bankers to open a certificate and will need to come back the following day. I asked if I can open online she said she thinks, then I asked if Wells Fargo does rate match she said yes. I stopped at another Wells Fargo and they said no rate match on CErtificates. Wells Fargo please train your staffSo I went to this location first off because I was short $700 , I got reimbursed but had a couple of questions on my account. I asked Kassandra if she could explain to me more thoroughly. But all I got was attitude from her when I asked more questions she looked at me like I was dumb was a stare down. She is the reason I will be closing my account and going with Chase bank. I had to drive to a other location by Northstar Mall and Stephanie kindly explained everything with no problem. Also I need to add when I got up and told her I was leaving a bad review for her she smirked at me mockingly and said go right ahead sir byeee. I never seen anyone in a bank act like she did today . I hate to leave bad reviews but she deserves it. Bad employee of month award goes to KassandraThis location has been repeatedly terrible service.

1st time their atm was down multiple times and they don’t have an atm inside like other locations.

Then today I couldn’t even get a cashiers check or money order through the drive thru. Like what???

Every other location I’ve been to this far has been able to do these 2 things.Bank belongs in the trash, drive through is Only for customer with account. No account so I went inside. Banker told me they can’t cash my check. Wells Fargo issued the check. Banker didn’t get even offer to make me an account. It’s hard not to feel like there was some sort of bias just saying.Victoria in the drive thru is always soooooo nice and efficient with her service. I come to do our bank run for work and she always has a smile on her face. I definitely don’t go any other branch!!!!!I went inside to make a deposit and only one teller was working & was actually in training.  One customer was ahead of me and she had to leave the teller & go to her car to get documents. I asked if they would merely take my deposit, and the answer was no that they had to wait on her to return.  What bank on plant earth other than Wells Fargo is this unprofessional?Worst banking experience I’ve ever had. Extremely unhelpful the banker I sat down to speak with was extremely rude. Didn’t answer any of my questions and presented me with fee after fee to complete the transaction I was trying to complete. Don’t bank with Wells FargoIt was fast and tellers are very friendlyPoor customer service.Excellent service by the staff, quite fast, more than in other branches of the same bank, it is recommended to visit","Positives:
- Victoria in the drive-thru provides excellent and efficient service
- Fast service by the staff
- Friendly tellers
- Good service in terms of speed compared to other branches

Room for improvement:
- Lack of manners and empathy from tellers and branch manager
- Inefficiency with transactions in the drive-thru
- Lack of clear explanation for why certain transactions could not be completed
- Inconsistent information provided by different employees
- Rude and unhelpful banker
- Multiple technical issues causing inconvenience for customers

126,Wells Fargo Bank,"4524 Fredericksburg Rd, San Antonio, TX 78201",San Antonio,"This is the bank I frequent but for yrs now I have not needed to step inside. I needed to open another account and didnt want to here cause of all the recent bad reviews .
Joe helped me out and even explained I could do it online and not make an appointment (no walk ins since they were about to close) since I already have an acct. Joe was knowledgeable of the app and guided us where we needed to go and had a very light and friendly demeanor. I'm glad I stopped in anyways.Saturday of Labor Day weekend was crazy. Tons of people in line, however, the bank was fully staffed with tellers and they had a banker greeting each customer and helping where he could. Excellent job managing a busy day!Long lines sometimes out the door and the workers are as slow as they can be and don't care about the customers time. In line for an hour or more sometimes. They aren't very friendly and they aren't very smart either. They shorted me just five dollars on a money order once and i had to go back and pay for another one for the rest, wouldn't help. Also never answer the phone and for some reason don't do money orders at the window. Y'all just hire anyone i guess.Showed up for a simple transaction minutes before closing and they cant help me. Lazy workers. Ain’t nobody wanna work anymore these days but they DO demand higher wages. Im switching over to Chase. Wells sucks. No wonder yall got sued for making fake accounts. It shows. Lazy workers hahaCustomer since 2004 and this and other are the nearest location. Ever since the Olmos Park Branch closed feel like all Wells have since failed on Customer Service. This particular location called several times with negative response. So decided to drive up and ask a simple question in regards to $2 bills “do you have any?” Not even that was able to answer like said no answer. So I pull up enter the branch and noticed a line. So I was ok Busy then…. So I called the branch and no phone ringing, I was ok maybe technical problems so I looked over to one of the desk and witnessed my number displaying on the phone but phone placed on silent. I looked over and see two ladies on their Financial Advisors post and one in her office and none of them bother to answer the phone. I made a comment out loud and was ignored. I left the long line without my transaction. So I tried calling other locations and still no answer but the big one on McCullough and 410 next to North Star did answer but didn’t have $2 bills.Worst service at this bank, was a few minutes late for my appointment then I asked the banker if I had to sign in somewhere, she asked me what service I needed and I replied I needed to open a business account. She asked me to have a seat, then 15 minutes later she asks me if I have the documents to open the account, i gave them to her and then she replied I would have to reschedule my appointment. Why make me wait 15 minutes and ask me for documents if you will make me reschedule?Horrible girls working at the teller windows. They speak down to you in very condescending manner. Completely unprofessional. I had to call in to corporate and log a complaint with them. These little girls with attitudes that they hire are the death of businesses. They think that you are bothering them to do their job. They deliberately give you wrong information (as verified in the call to corporate) and they inconvenience you by not completing your transactions. Man....Wells Fargo sucks. There are so many other banks that would roll out the red carpet for more members. Maybe Wells Fargo already has more members than they need? Who knows....I just know that I'll be closing my Wells Fargo account and moving over to IBC Bank on Monday.By far the worst Wells Fargo I’ve been to. Employees are so slow. It really doesn’t take 3 employees helping out one customer when there’s a long line of customers. They slack way too much.Arriving just before 5pm. The door is already locked. People inside. A woman opened the door for someone to let them out. When I knocked on the door. She looked at me and then just looked away.They couldn't attend me and I spent a week having an appointment because I made it a week before I got to the appointment and they told me that they didn't have my scheduled appointment, I made the appointment again and the same thing happened.  Today when I came back I was waiting and they didn't attend my appointment it was 2:30, I've been here since 2:16 I lined up to ask for my appointment but they took a long time in the line by the time I asked it was already 2:42 and They told me it was late.  Other people arrived and he attended them less to me.  I'm patient but this is annoying.Lobby is closed sometimes. 😟 Have to get bus to go to another branch, even though I live walking distance to Fred. Rd./crossroads branch.Have no car. …The clerk on the front didn’t help 3 customers waiting for help and she instead went to lunch and there was no one to help. Wells fargo is worst every day.Long lines to do transactions with the cashiers,  really poor customer service and not friendly service.  It's faster use the ATM outside.Close it down. It NEVER has change for commercial business. Rude employees just say we have no coins. Not a sorry not a nothing has slow. Waited an hour for NOTHINGWow, again wells Fargo at its best . There's only 3 people in line and I've been here for over 20 minutesLady at the commercial drive thru was not helpful enough to close out my account and move it to chaseOnly one person can Notarize!!It's 11:30am and the lines at the regular drivethru are already closed, and the business line is open... here are 12pm hours, even so they are providing service inside.
It's 11:30 am and the lines at the regular drivethru are already closed, and the commercial line is open... here they close at 12 pm, they are still serving inside.
Incredible, bad very bad!They should be able to have more costumer service attendants, a lot of delays in the bank

128,Wells Fargo Bank,"40 NE Interstate 410 Loop, San Antonio, TX 78216",San Antonio,"Prior to the pandemic I use to go inside the bank. Then they closed it. It was atm or drive thru only. Is the bank now opened for services? I want to open another account. Also are the drive throughs still opened? Lately they've been closed. The one on 410 and McCullough.Turned me away to open 3 business account. Had documents. Diclosed the amount of money the accounts would be running. The two ladies were asking questions looking for a reason to turn me away.  I stated this is my in person attempt, after a failed online attempt at opening. They still didnt care. I guess ill goto chase or another large bank.Google says drive-thru is open til 6p. No it wasn’t m! Race to make it but it was closed. 😠 …Slow and could not accomplish any of the simple things we needed. We walked out and will open the new accounts elsewhere.They never have any representative available to open a business savings account, Always when I come they told me you need to do an appointment online, but I saw at representatives just spending time talking each others.Air quality unsafe due to mold in air. Left sick. Should be closed and cleaned for safety of employees.Great customer service 👏 👌 …Probably the worst customer service. Tried to make a payment and they wouldn’t let me and said they couldn’t tell me why. I had to call a number. Norma was not very helpful.Closes too early!

129,Wells Fargo Bank,"6919 S Zarzamora St, San Antonio, TX 78224",San Antonio,"Absolutely horrible location, this location has a very cramped parking lot that seems like it’s an accident waiting to happen. The drive thru usually only has the commercial lane and one regular lane and the service time is ridiculous! For a simple deposit I have waited over an hour in line then when it was my turn, it took 20 minutes. In my opinion it was the biggest mistake to close down the other location on sw military. I never waited long to be serviced.Very slow location. I was in the drive thru and told them I wanted to make a withdrawal. I waited 10 mins for them to tell me they sent the wrong slip and they were sending a new one. I was the only one in line at the time so there was no reason for them to take this long to tell me that. 1 single withdrawal took 20 mins. That’s ridiculous.Angelica Ramirez denied to help us because after sitting there on Saturday it was “15 mins to close” advised us to make an appointment. We made an appointment on my lunch hour Monday. We arrived at bank she was with customers that I presume were from an earlier appointment. She remembered us because she failed to acknowledge me and dragged out her previous customer with if there were any other questions. A man came in she got up left her customers sitting and us waiting cutting more into my appointment time, told the man “let me just get my belongings out” and proceeds to walk out once bank in tells customers sitting okay just go to tellers and your account is good to go. We get up to walk to her desk and she goes to the back just ignoring us than when she finally comes back she doesn’t address me she quickly in less than two mins finds something wrong with our ids and ends appointment. Of course another banker steps in and has someone waiting on her as well moral of story Zarzamora will just wait waste your time. They offered to have me speak to manager on site but this was well past me being irritated in their ability to perform their jobs.This is the worst bank I've ever been to. There is zero sense of urgency.  I can't continue to wait for hours on end to get change orders or deposits receipts. The ladies all want to have gossip hour when it's time to get customers in and out. Something has to change.

03/03/2023
I got to the bank and 850 am with already 3 cars waiting in front of me. I'm still waiting in line for service. It's been over an hour now. When is this going to be corrected and improved?? I have a business to run.

05/06/2023
Here we go again. I don't understand why this location can't get staffed and have a sense of urgency. I continue to waste hours of my management time to stand at this bank or sit in the drive through.  The line inside the bank is 15 people with nonstop walking in. 10 customers waiting for a banker and only 4 cashiers. Enough is enough. Get this location staffed based off of foot traffic. This is insane.

05/30/2023
Again it's 908 am and the doors are NOT open yet. Did the times change foe this location?? It's a daily thing. Always opening late.Drive-thru takes way too long. Had only 4 cars ahead of me and waited over an hour and a half. Avoid this location at all costs.Absolutely the slowest location...got to the line at 9:30. It's now 10:50 and still waiting. Meanwhile management inside seem to be more interested in talking amongst one another.Waited 30 minutes just to be scammed. Was issued a check by a company with a business account with Wells Fargo but they charged me $7.50 to cash at their own bank. Thank god I dont bank with these jokers. They couldn't even offer to waive the fee after waiting 30 minutes in line. This bank has always had scummy practices and I'm glad I'd never bank here. If you bank here do yourself a favor and move your money to somewhere that wont create a checking account or sign you up for a credit card without your knowledge. Once a scammer always a scammer.Your bank has the.slowest.sercixe times for.not only commercial but personal banking. Your Mgr just walk.around looking over tellers shoulders. Worst experience in my life.This branch has been a nightmare since we signed on. Today I tried to make a deposit outside at their ATM because they can’t take deposits over 1k on the app and the drive lines and lobby usually take more than an hour just to make a deposit even during slow hours. The ATM outside this location ate my nonprofits deposit and jammed the machine. when I went inside for help the bankers answer was simply, “We don’t handle that” I asked her would you please come out and help and she said, I have customers and walked away from me. She was greeting people at the door! There was absolutely zero concern for the customers or their money. It was severely unprofessional, and just rude. This isn’t my first awful experience at this branch. This experience has me making the proper preparations to move my money to a bank that is attentive, and more appreciative of our business. By the looks of the reviews I’m not the only one who feels this way.Honestly this has to be the worst Wells Fargo branch I’ve ever been to. I usually come to make a commercial deposit and the line usually has about 4 cars so it seems like it’s not going to be a long wait however, they can literally take over an hour to assist. Like why the long wait ? Even if I go inside it’s the same thing the employees are just talking their life away I guess instead of keeping it moving and I get it they should give great customer service but they should be able to move a little faster so us other customers can be assisted quickly and get back to work or back to the rest of our day. Please Branch Managers help your employees be a little more efficient and quick so they can help your WF branch not have such bad reviews because of the long wait !!!This Wells Fargo was by far the best. I’ve been to other locations where they weren’t as happy to help. Here they made me feel welcome and accommodated my needsYour drive-thru service is very slow. Everytime I have to come here for my company, I wait over 30 minutes to an hour.Literally 2 employees an there's like 14 people in line. Long wait . To many customers not enuff employeesThese 5 stars are literally just for Ms Alejandra Sauceda I came after work with my kids there was no appointments available in this branch or  anywhere for that same day I urgently needed a check to be stamped by them and when her appointment canceled she came to get me at my truck the tellers were rude but she makes the difference in that building thank u ma'amTHIS WELLS FARGO SUCKS AT CUSTOMER SERVICE EVERYTIME I HAVE TO GO I HAVE TO WAIT AT LEAST 1 HOUR IN THE DRIVE THREW THEY HAVE 4 LANES BUT ALL THE TIME ONLY HAVE 1 TELLER IT SUCKS ... IT DONT MATTER PERSONAL ACCOUNT OR CORPORATE BUSINESS ACCOUNT ITS ALWAYS A 1 HOUR WAIT ... AND YET MAKES YOU MADDER THAT YOU SEE EMPLOYEES WALKING AROUND INSIDE LAUGHING A JOKING AROUND INSTEAD OF TAKING CUSTOMERS DEPOSITS OR WITHDRAWALS
.REMEMBER.. 1 HOUR PLAN ACCORDINGLY!!!! GOOD LUCK !!!!worst bank ever here i can never make a deposit there is always somethig wrong with atmsThis branch is the worst at moving any of the drive thru service lines. It takes almost 1+ hour to help 5 cars? This is unacceptable for employees trying to do a quick bank run before opening the store up. The branch management needs to assess the needs of the customer and efficiency of how the bank lines need to take. This is very very unacceptable. I've tried countless times to come earlier or later to see if the lines improve. It does not at all. It takes longer later in the day. This is a simple review and I know my review may not change anything. Let this be a insight to what you may face coming through this branch service line. As you can see in the photo I'm here in this line on a Tuesday 45 minutes and have not moved but one car. This needs to be addressed by someone at the top. Again simply expressing my frustration as I wait in this line to do a simple commercial deposit. It's a waste of time and can attend to much better things in my workplace then waiting for someone to simply handle our deposit needs. Someone please address this matter to corporate. -5 Stars....Why does this bank do this to me ? I'm inside and there's literally 10 people in line and only one teller . I've been here 26 mins in line . People are complaining and manager said I'll give you a other option go through the drive thru. Wells Fargo courtesy was not here at all they are extremely rude. The person's name was Frank his desk is directly behind of the lineWorst bank ever literally waited in line at drive thru with only  2 cars in line …that took like 30 mins only to wait in lobby for another 25mins …..tellers jumping around helping other tellers and not assisting the cust at their own window…. Just horrible ….. y’all need to do better ….
Very disappointedI goofed in forgetting most banks close at 12p on Saturdays, so I got there at 11:50 & joined a line of others. I don't bank with Wells Fargo, but needed to send money to someone who does. The staff was very courteous & kind. They help so many people who don't even bank there, nor know how to do what they need to get done, which is most likely exhausting for the tellers/employees.
Thanks for serving the Southside well! Special shout-out to Esmeralda for being an MVP of being kind & conversational with every customer.

NOTE: Yes, you will wait awhile. It's not their fault that it's an extremely busy location. A majority of the 1 stars are people who don't know their own bank's policies or their definition of customer service is a bit out wack for the area.Literally came to make just two deposits! One car in line in commercial lane and none in any other lane! I am still sitting here in the drive thru going in 45mins now!!This by far the worst bank, one cashier available only, wait time is a long time. Girls are just walking around doing nothing.Very very slow, it took an hour to move one vehicle from the drive thru and they have 4 lanes
They need to hire more tellersThe drive thru takes so frickin long. It literally took me almost an hour and a half just to get to the window.Theres always 30 people in. Only 2 cashiersbad service very slowThe worst.  20 ppl in line and 1 teller.good customer service 👍 …Customer service NONE...S...l...o...w...Terrible service to rude rudeEverything is super slow and there is no staff in the morning…..","Positives:
- Courteous and kind staff

Room for Improvement:
- Cramped parking lot
- Long wait times in both drive-thru and inside the bank
- Lack of sense of urgency among employees
- Inconsistent opening times

130,Wells Fargo Bank,"999 E Basse Rd Ste 300, San Antonio, TX 78209",San Antonio,"So called 8 times today, once from right out in front of the branch. No one answered. I asked the large man with the beard why they don't answer their phone. He said he was busy with customers. Interestingly enough, no one was in the branch. He also said that they were too busy to rent me a safe deposit box, and I would have to make an appointment again in an empty lobby. Well, after 23 years, I am done with Wells Fargo and PNC right across the street, which has better hours and time to sign me up right now.Did not want to do this but John the ‘manager’ at this location has mismanaged his staff to the point where sometimes we’re allowed to have service and sometimes not depending on the teller. We’re a multimillion dollar business and there’s no excuse to lack on consistency, especially when you have the proper identification to withdraw money that is crucial to having your business run. Today he shorted my colleague $500 and to make matters worse proceeded to bad mouth me during his transaction. How unprofessional. We are absolutely disgusted by this behavior and mismanagement of money, time and staff.Drive thru line too slow, narrow drive with no way to get out of line if you don't want to wait. I felt trapped and when it was finally my turn, I escaped without doing my transaction. I just wanted to get away.Outstanding customer service!!!  Every time I go thru the drive thru bank teller Salma remembers me and addresses me by name and always ask how I am doing.  Love the warm customer service that she displays because now days it is lost.  So Thank you Salma for always taking care of my banking needs!!!!Always understaffed at drive through. Waiting 28min to service a vehicle is amateurish at best. Its not like your counting change....Horrible experience,  i got a account here and wish I didn't. Will be switching banks.","Positives:
- One customer appreciates the outstanding customer service they receive from a specific bank teller at the drive-thru.
- The drive-thru bank teller remembers the customer's name and asks about their well-being, providing a warm customer service experience.

Room for Improvement:
- Multiple customers complain about the lack of phone call assistance. They report not receiving any answer when calling the branch, even when physically present outside the branch.
- One customer expresses frustration with the branch's inability to rent them a safe deposit box promptly and requires them to make an appointment.
- A customer states that the branch manager has mismanaged their staff, leading to inconsistent service experiences depending on the teller.
- A large man with a beard, possibly an employee, is criticized for claiming to be busy with customers while no one was in the branch and refusing to rent a safe deposit box.
- One customer complains about a slow and narrow drive-thru line that made them feel trapped and led them to abandon their transaction.
- Another customer expresses disappointment with the long wait times at the drive-thru and considers it unprofessional.

Miscellaneous:
- One customer mentions switching banks due to their horrible experience and regretting opening an account with this branch."
131,Wells Fargo Bank,"16414 San Pedro Ave Ste 100, San Antonio, TX 78232",San Antonio,"I was pretty disappointed. I brought my daughter in to open an account.  We came directly from when school got out. They said it takes half and hour to open her account and they close in 20 minutes. So I would need to take her out of school to open an account. Feels crummy after being a customer here for over 20 years. A little hustle or care for the customers from the employees would be appreciatedTook the bus here as I could withdraw without having to walk up to a drive up atm but the tellers were closed even though hours posted on door said it should be open, then I walked up the the drive up atm and it said “get cash” option was unavailable. Very frustrating for a person who doesn’t drive.Wow this is kinda like their financial Hq in south West tx so service is amazing from a regular checking account to complete financial advisor to brokerage accouts and more financial products and services all under one roof including 4 lane drive thru night deposit box 24 HR drive by atmOnly one teller while I have to wait in line is annoying but could be worse spent 45 minutes in usaa drive thru lane because the inside bank still isn't open.Good staff, efficient and fast !Just rotten experience trying to close our accounts.  Fees.  Fees.  Fees.  Not this particular bank, rather their whole consumer process online/telephone.Great serviceThere is a Bank theree!!!

132,Wells Fargo Bank,"13703 I-10, San Antonio, TX 78249",San Antonio,"Brian Martinez was so helpful. He was with his higher up. He enquirer what was I here for. He said he will be with me in 15 minutes. He created a profile in less than 10 minutes time. Businesses need people like him who attend to customers right away and assist them.Teller by the name of Bri lacks patience and kindness. She is a bad representation of what Wells Fargo says they stand for. She sends me a drive through canister with a pen that had leaked all of of its ink into the canister. I asked for another canister, she then said it will take 5-10 mins for her to get a new canister while she attended to the other cars that came and left around me. I then suggested to wiped down the canister so I can get my transaction done, conveniently there was no supv or manager to assist.  We all can have a bad day but she lacks professionalism.Opened up my business accounts with Anthony and he was thorough and informative. I would work with him again.Hate this location literally takes forever everytime I go inside, the teller always has attitude, and I can NEVER just cash my check, put it in the ATM or mobile upload I ALWAYS have to go inside deposit my check then withdrawal from account makes NO sense and they keep rejecting my check even though it's a PAYROLL check and letting UNAUTHORIZED transactions go through 🤦Worse customer service every.  I have personal and business accounts with Wells Fargo and every time I go to this branch to get help.  I see all the staff is falling asleep and they always say come back later.  I hate this branch.  I hope senior management takes some action against this branchI went to the bank to make a withdrawal during my lunch break. I wanted $100s instead of $50s so I didn't go to the ATM. The lobby was closed so I had to go through the drive through. It literally took them 35 minutes to process my withdrawal and then they said they didn't have $100s. What an absolute and complete waste of my time. I didn't think I would waste my entire lunch break getting a simple withdrawal. Get your act together.Beautiful bank, great service.Wells Fargo is a terrible bank. They have no concern for customers. They hide behind there rules instead of doing what is right. Close your accounts and bank somewhere else.Idk why they want us to set up appointments to speak with a banker. They still take their sweet time... Super annoying...Please don't try to go to this branch of this bank the customer service was really bad now they don't care about anything because  treat me badQuick, polite service.No one EVER answers the phone!","Positives:

133,Wells Fargo Bank,"4351 Medical Dr, San Antonio, TX 78229",San Antonio,"If you need to get something at a teller window at this branch you'll be stuck waiting 25 mins in line since they seem to think one teller window is enough. 4 people waiting for 25 mins, while they service one person taking care of everything in the world. You need to bring back full service to the drive through if you're going to have this kind of service inside.Very friendly and helpful tellers at the drive thru.I've been waiting at least 40 minutes in drive thru.  Decided to go in lobby...big mistake!
Spoke with rhe manager and just asked me to wait. Very poor customer service.
If it wasn't for my employer banking here I would never come here!The line at their place is ridiculous. Waiting for 1 hour for them to get you taken care of does not make since. Hire more people or get the manager involved to help during the peak demand.I have been banking with this branch for almost 3 years. Every time I go in, they are very professional and nice. Keep up the AWSUM job!!!The chaser helenisa is so rude 😤 …Fast and friendly service.","Positives:

134,Wells Fargo Bank,"3027 W Woodlawn Ave, San Antonio, TX 78228",San Antonio,"I walked in with a simple request to close my checking account. Unfortunately, the tellers don't know how to use a computer. So, I asked for the manager to help. I think her name was Patricia, not sure, but she has ridiculous eyebrows that she spends hours & too much makeup on. She should spend some time learning how to use a computer, because she didn't know how to close my account either. When I asked if anyone was competent enough to navigate ancient Wells Fargo technology, she looked me in the eyes and said, ""sorry, I'm absolutely useless and incapable of thinking"". I felt sorry for her handicap, but realized Wells Fargo gives back to those less fortunate & provided her a job when no other employer would ever consider it. Talking to her was like talking to a broken robot stuck in a loop, my IQ literally started dropping & I realized the lackadaisical stupidity at Wells Fargo is contagious. I thanked her for wasting my time & for her extraordinary uselessness. She enthusiastically thanked me too, like a special person does, & waved farewell as she drooled on herself. If Patricia can be the useless manager of Wells Fargo on 3027 W Woodlawn Ave 78228, then spider monkeys deserve employment there too. Then maybe I'll keep my account open.Customer service there is none. All you do is hold my money because anything else your employees will not do or cannot. 3x I have had appointment to add a person to an act.  3x cancel on me.  What is your purpose. One banker but yet could not help me add, but yet we are held bound to make appts.  Screw your bank. Today i will pull all my money 25,000 withdraw.Terrible customer service. I won’t be coming back and may close my accounts.
Teller took off with my ID for a minor withdrawal and made me wait for half an hour to check on things. This is ridicuous.They also have 2 H/C PARKING PLACES.","Positives:
- The bank provides employment opportunities for individuals who may have difficulty finding work elsewhere.

Room for improvement:
- The tellers and manager need to improve their computer skills in order to efficiently process customer requests.
- Customer service needs improvement, as some customers have had negative experiences, including cancelled appointments and long wait times.
- The bank should address the issue of a teller taking a customer's ID and making them wait for an extended period of time.

Miscellaneous:
- The bank has designated handicap parking places."

136,Wells Fargo Bank,"10659 Culebra Rd, San Antonio, TX 78251",San Antonio,"The bankers have no idea  on what they are doing the wasted almost 2 hours and he could help me
I need it to cancel a cashier check the banker send me to talk to the teller  I waited 25 min in line for the bank teller the lady told  me i need  it to talk to the banker, I waited another 40min for the banker, then he told me to go back  on Tuesday cause he was busy , while I was waiting someone else walk in and he took care of them without having an appointment.  The other banker was just there  listening didn’t offer to help.

Worse costumer service from their bankers
I been going to  the Potranco location
For  years never had a bad experience but this location is horribleThe worse bank, I only come here because of my work to make deposits. I would never bank with them personally. I came here one day at around 2:30 pm and the drive thru was closed. Another time I waited over an hour in the commercial line. Horrible!!!I went in to take out money and the banker could not give me my money for whatever reason worst customer service all because a manager was not in how is that my fault? SmfhOne of the slowest locations I have been to. I was first in line and needed a simple withdrawal and no one was able to help me at the desk within my 30 min lunch break. Very unfortunate.Came to the bank on 2/25/23.  Drive through was closed, even though it states on line that they are open until 12 pm.  Associate came to the window, stated they were short handed and only lobby was opened. Such an inconvenience. No manager on duty as well.The teller was very helpful and quickly accommodated us with a banker, that’s why I give 2 stars instead of 1. I am a loyal Wells Fargo customer and I tried to come in to help my sister open up a new account before she goes off to college. To my surprise the banker was absolutely dismissive and had 0 customer service skills. He looked at us like we were a burden to his day, made no conversation, and eventually dismissed us for having a missing document. I did not even bother to make any further questions because from the looks of it he didn’t care to help us at all. I was very dissatisfied with the service today. PSA: Don’t work in the service industry if you don’t want to help people.Great location, everyone was helpful and there’s so many options to take care of what I need online or atm 7 mins I’m done back home or work. I prefer atm on busy days, I just check Google to see the high traffic days. Showed me how to make appointments since I’m very busy. I set my account up online instead of waiting around I have more important stuff to do. Can’t believe people still cashing checks like the 90’s smh I come in for items I can’t do online or over the phone like cashiers checks money ordersWe have Banked with this Branch for over 10 years! Everyone is respectful and have amazing Customer service! They don’t get enough credit for all the hard work they do!As if it isn't frustrating enough to have wait multiple days for an appoint to set up a business account, getting wrong information from the banker, Aggie, with his manager sitting right next to him is even worse.

I was told - and had it repeated for additional clarification - that while I wouldn't be able to see my business and personal accounts on the same webpage, I would be able transfer money between the two online. That was false / incorrect. I currently have to call every time I need to pay myself (from business to personal). I'm being told it's because Aggie and his manager set me up as a key executive and not the business owner. It's a single-owner Texas LLC, who else would be the owner if not me?! Now I have to find a branch further from my home to find someone competent that understand that someone has to own my LLC and it's obviously me.The bald man working today at 2:15pm at the teller drive up was extremely rude. Not only did it take 15 minutes to deposit cash, he didn’t say thank you or anything.. just sent a crinkled receipt through the tubes and turned his back away from us. Horrible experience and really bad customer service!Terrible location, I try calling to open a BUISNESS account at least 4 times a day to check the needed paperwork and NO ONE answers. Not sure why; I know for a fact there’s no logical explanation as to why this is but I’m fed up with it and will be reporting it to the hyper ups. VERY NEGLIGENT and I expected better.Finally after calling 7 times, they pick up, and when they do my conversation was filled with attitude and unprofessionalism, find another Wells Fargo bank people, cause they are not it.Walked away and left valuables on the counter called like 10 times no answer returned to the bank and asked for help all I got was a whole lot of nothing no one would look at the camera no one even tried to help.  Should have taken my business elsewhere!!!Drive thru closed..at 945am...then go inside...line out the door with ONE TELLER WORKING!! very frustrated...do better Wells FargoMade my deposit and got cash from atm. No long line but prefer atm service if I have no time to spare.Came here a few weeks ago and some guy was rude, clueless and disrespectful. He knew nothing about wire transfers.This is ridiculous for the last two weeks have been trying to make an appointment I leave my information and speak with a teller and they tell me I’m gonna get a call back and nothing I call and nobody answesThey only have one banker opening new accountsUnbelievable how the ATMS outside never work!ATM’S outside never workDo not answer the phones and claim there is no notary.Worst bank in the USA.Adan was great very knowledgeableSlow tellers","Positives:

137,Wells Fargo Bank,"5703 N Foster Rd, San Antonio, TX 78244",San Antonio,"This location is always busy. It’s so sad to see that the only employee that has any sense of urgency is gabby. The lady that works the drive thru. Besides her everyone else moves slower then a sloth to get anything done. Wouldn’t recommend for anyone to come to this location. High key trying to get my company to close our accounts and move to a different bank because it has been proven that they do not care about their speed of service.They close early, as we came Friday 10 minutes before 5pm as they were locking up, asked why they were closing early as we just needed a cashiers check and was rudely told by a lady with glasses and brown hair they couldn’t help and if we didn’t leave they would call the cops on us!  That to me was super unprofessional.
The next day came in the morning an hour before they close and the line was outrageously long out the door with only one teller working, asked a gentleman to only be told if I was here 30 mins prior there was no line and that his manager will be up to help. Why wasn’t the manager helping in the first place, the teller was sooo slow until the manager got up there to help and the line moved then quickly.
Will never recommend coming to this bank until customer service is fixed properly!Attention: Upper management, HR and staffing! Please help this location by allowing more employees to work here. I have been going to this location for about 4 years now but within the last 2 years I've really seen the customer service go down. I only go to this branch now if I have at least an hour or more to spare. Even with an appointment I waited 35 minutes and the notary I needed took maybe 5 minutes. The branch manager, Mr. Gomez who had to step up and do the job of a banker was extremely helpful. While waiting for my notary I could hear the new male teller working the drivethru. He was extremely rude asking a customer to give him a correct account number when the customer didnt provide him with an accurate one. No please or thank you. Just"" send me to correct number."" His tone was rude and he seemed just really annoyed to be helping someone in the drive through. This branch is very understaffed and needs help. The area around Foster Rd and FM78 has grown and is growing and there needs to be more staff to support our community. It will continue to get worse without proper staffing.This bank is absolutely the worst for handling my mother's account as the executor. The in person rep himself is having problems helping me pay my mom's bill and he works here.

This should have been a simple process but an hour later he's still on the phone and no action can be made to pay her bill yet.

I won't be opening up an account here with all this difficulty.

Not to mention when I spoke to the estate department last week Annti or Annty refused to tell the Wells Fargo process for paying off a decease customers account after I explained I have all the court documents saying I'm the executor.

This has been the one and only creditor that has been so difficult to work with.Samantha refused to cash my check after waiting twenty minutes while she worked with her friend. They always discriminate at this location and make excuses. I had to mobile deposit my check in the parking and walk back in to get cash. It's no wonder this place keeps wracking up the one star reviews.I went to Wells Fargo again on 05/15/23 I was in the drive-through for 45 minutes then I turned around and went inside and I was in the lobby for over an hour just to pay my mortgage. Help me make that sense. They only had two cashiers in the building. Where are all of the employees? I don’t understand every time I go there and I only go when it’s time to pay my mortgage. I need to find another Wells Fargo close by because I dread going there every month.45 min in the commercial lane and no one to take care of customers.  This is ridiculous....
Another day with 30 min wait. Personnel on their personal phone and a line full of customers out and inside.
This place is not getting any better .There’s always something unprofessional about this location. I never have this problem at my local near by Wells Fargo location or any other location. They are always super slow short staff. Just and overall horrible experience at this location.I had experience one time that happened a long time go back in 2019 I came to withdrawal money the amount I requested was like 1000 the teller took 50 dollars but told myself I’m not going to pursue this. but count your money before leave to make sure it’s the right amount.Worst bank ever it took them 35 min to do a freaking simple deposit. Need to move my business elsewhere.I stood in line for over half an hour for the 3rd time in two weeks just to run out of time, and had to leave the bank without getting my banking needs finished. One teller and some guy watching her were the only people at the windows, and the line was out to the front door every time. Worst customer service I've ever experienced in any financial institution. The whole time I'm staring at a huge sign proclaiming the Wells Fargo commitment to customer courtesy. Hiring enough people to take care of your customers needs would be a good start.They need more tellers working the lobby. One teller and the line is out the door!!!

Update: Nothing has changed. Still only one teller working the lobby and if you make an appointment you will still have to wait hours to see a banker.Get ready to wait and wait and wait.  You will spend three times longer than other banks.  It does not matter if you go inside or use the drive-thru.That store must be close as soon as possible. Their service is lame, slow and bad vibes. There's a rude, grotesque and bad vibe Hispanic messy hair old woman as teller that didn't attended me well and left me 15 minutes waiting on lane and I just wanted to break a $20 bill and then after those minutes, she told me about I had to get banking account with them to do that, being that I wanted to ask this before but she said that she was busy and I had to wait until my turn on lane. Also they need to hire more people because they are pretty slow in the teller service working with a couple people only, one of the lobby and the other one in the drive-thru.$9,000 missing from my parents account after stopping at this branch while traveling. No one answers their phones.Went to the bank for an appointment set from two weeks ago. Only to find out the man working the floor said my appointment was  set for another location. Looking at my confirmation I was at the right location. The one I set it for, foster rd. Such a waste of my time. So hands me a card with a ladies number and name said she will call me .  No call all morning. Mid afternoon I called her. She states she never got an email. Waste of time . I will refinance with another bank!!Alex Perez was outstanding showed courtesy very well, he lived up to the the banks business rule and made a dreadful process more pleasant with his customer service, thanks very much Alex PerezWorst customer service I've ever experienced in any financial institution.Terrible customer service including the manager went in on March 10 2022 at 3:30  terrible never been treated so badly ever at a Wells FargoWaited 15 mins at the front of the line for change for 60 super simple the customer service here is the worst EVERA bank that doesn’t accept cash deposit if it’s a personal account.  That’s how you know they only care about corporations and not people.No receptionist.  No sign in sheet.  No security. No organization.  No service.  Awful service.  Blaming this on Covid is a copout.The number provided is automated and no live person ever answers. There are several inquiries on this post that are NEVER answered.Always professional, friendly. Timely mannerNo staffCompany is full of thiefs and will steal from youVery bad customer service, they do not have workers, there is only one cashier and there is a long line in the line of business, the staff is not trained","Positives:
- Gabby, the employee at the drive-thru, has a sense of urgency

The 2 drive up ATMs have been down since Thursday night and the walk up ATM has been down since Sunday morning. I picked this bank for convenience and it has been an inconvenienceThis location has had one of their drive up ATM’s down for the longest time at least over 3 months+. Now the second and only drive up ATM that had been working since I last used a few months+ is down. Their walk up ATM where there is a long line of people including elderly and disabled are out standing and waiting in a heat index of OVER 100°. Where is Wells Fargo loyalty of providing customer service?? Where is the Bank manager and or owner who should be taking care of this matter? Rather than having the customer send an email to someone who will probably hit the send to trash button. No excuses!! Thank God I have an acct. open with Frost National Bank who’s drive up ATM is working and not far at all.
7/14/23 UPDATE
Received a few emails from Wells from departments that handle this kind of stuff. Email stated that one of drive up ATM’s is up and running and the other drive up ATM still needs to be repaired due to someone messing with it. Hopefully it gets repaired really soon.

Either get the atms working or have the bank opened 24/7.This place is trash,  since when do we have to make a appointment to open a new bank account??there was no one waiting or anything,  he could have just took me in. But instead he said make a appointment online. This is my first time coming to Wells Fargo and I was exited to get a new bank. But this was unprofessional and definitely didn't meet my service.  On to a better bank.The Wellsfargo ATM on Castroville road are constantly down! No matter what day or time you go! Get it fixed wells Fargo(6-26-23)Ridiculous. The Tuesday after Labor Day and only one teller working. No support or anyone lending a hand. Watched 6 customers give up and walk out before I did.Literally walked in to open an account said he had no openings for the day! Mind you it was empty! Said he was booked until the following Monday… And as read online and spoke over the phone you do not need an appointment!!! WHEN I ASKED IF THERE WERE OTHER BANKERS HE SAID NO! Hmm found it funny that he’s running a whole bank on his own.. Took our business to FROST BANK AND WAS RECEIVED AT ARRIVAL…Nobody answers the phone. I have called more than 14 times to ask about a check, but have yet to a reply... It's always 'we are sorry, bankers at this branch are unable to answer your call at this time'They never answer the phone. I had no idea it was impossible to speak to anyone at this branch. Hmm. No wonder it's got a HORRIBLE 2.8 RATING.🤔 …I love that theres more than one atmIt's a good place, it's just that a lot of people come, hahaha but otherwise, everything is fineFIRST TIME IN THIS BANK AND IT WAS WONDERFUL, MR. DANIEL CASTILLA DURAN SERVED US EXCELLENTLY 👍😃 HE SIMPLY HELPED US WITH EVERYTHING WE NEEDED, IT'S GOOD THAT WELLS FARGO HAS PEOPLE THIS KIND AND TRAINED 10/10 ⭐️⭐️⭐ ️⭐️⭐️ANABEL ORTIZ was very helpful & kind and patient to me and my mom

141,Wells Fargo Bank,"750 E Mulberry Ave Fl 1, San Antonio, TX 78212",San Antonio,"Went in today after opening an account, both Angel and Javier were awesome, friendly and were able to help quickly get me in and out? Nice lobby!I am giving 3 stars because the location it’s nice , and convenient. But you need to train better your tellers .
Today I had to express send Money to a different country . This teller Monica asked me what kind of dollars ? Like we have different dollars? I couldn’t believe it so I didn’t respond her ignorant question .
So after she finished my transaction she gave me attitude
I think Wells Fargo if you are managing my money you should have people with more acknowledge about money   IT ONLY EXIST AMERICAN DOLLARS MONICA  Google it or ask Siri …female teller was incompetent and appeared high and asking inappropriate questions about my check which I received after a car accident. “Were you in a car accident, hopefully it wasn’t your fault” she said then proceeded to talk about how she had recently gotten into a car accident which I do not care to hear about when I’m running an errand like depositing a check. After I got home I got in contact with the bank to make a complaint over the phone, and I was then placed on a hold for 10 minutes. I was told I was being transferred to someone who would take the complaint only to be hung up on. As someone who works with the public every day this is unacceptable customer service.Drive thru at the mulberry location and Basse location are closed, they have been for about three months, that is ridiculous especially for someone with a small child not very convenient and no one ever answers the phone!Customer representatives Jessica Ramirez was  very limited on her knowledge making her unable to help properly. She was rude and incompetent. I do not recommend opening an account with this company, especially when it's been proven they steal from their customers.Huge thanks to Alex P. who assisted me with the utmost professional attitude on multiple occasions.This branch is a decent one that picks up phone calls. Lot of the other branches, especially on the south side of town are terrible - so I guess in comparison this branch looks good, but objectively speaking the branch is what you should expect when you go to any bank.Nobody will answer the phone. I have called three Wells Fargo's, and nobody will answer the phone on a Thursday at 10:30 am.","Positives:
- Angel and Javier provided excellent customer service and were efficient in assisting the customer.
- The lobby of the bank branch was nice and convenient.
- Alex P. consistently displayed a professional attitude and provided helpful assistance on multiple occasions.
- The branch generally picks up phone calls, which is better than other branches, especially on the south side of town.

Room for improvement:
- The tellers at the bank branch need better training and knowledge about different currencies.
- Monica, a teller at the branch, asked an ignorant question about different kinds of dollars, which was seen as unprofessional.
- A female teller appeared to be incompetent and asked inappropriate questions, which was considered unacceptable customer service.
- When making a complaint over the phone, the customer was placed on hold for 10 minutes and then hung up on, indicating a lack of efficient customer service.
- The drive thru at the Mulberry and Basse locations have been closed for three months, inconveniencing customers, especially those with small children.
- Jessica Ramirez, a customer representative, was limited in her knowledge and provided rude and incompetent assistance.

Miscellaneous:
- It has been proven that the company steals from its customers, making it not recommended to open an account with them.
- The customer attempted to contact three Wells Fargo branches on a Thursday morning but nobody answered the phone."
142,Wells Fargo Bank,"8903 Military Dr W, San Antonio, TX 78245",San Antonio,"I am second time here and on the first time it was closed and no sign or notification. Today is my second time and their system is down.What's the point of making appointments if they're gonna be accepting walk-ins anyway?
Not bothered with the banker, but the manager.
Either commit to appointments or have more bankers at the location.Waited in line behind ONE car at the drive through for 25 minutes to make a cash deposit. I called the branch to ask if the drive through was closed and was told “it sure isn’t” (after many, many rings). Miraculously, the line moved less than 2 minutes after that 🤔. I’ve been with Wells Fargo for over 22 years, and moves to different cities, so I’ve been to LOTS of branches, and this is by far the slowest one ever. I’ve probably written 3 reviews in my life for any type of business or service, so it’s that frustrating at this bank.Only two tellers helping customers for inside bank and drive thru! Not faulting them though. It's a shame that even in the banks there's a shortage of employees!  People it's time to get back to work!!!This is the worst bank location to come to do business. Nobody wants to do anything. I come here for make some changes to my account and they said they are busy. Nobody inside.Horrible customer service manager is very rude as well as the teller. I asked for their names and they refused to give me their namesAlways wonderful service and very nice professional people. Not a member but I make commercial deposits. Drive thru is always fast.I was withdrawing money from my account and the teller kept asking me what I was doing with the money (mind u it was only $200 in coin) told her to mind her business. I can withdraw in whatever denomination I choose if it's available. No I don't need a business account to get change. I've been with Wells Fargo for over a decade and this is the worst branch. I don't need my bank in my personal business. Do better .I now go to a different branch who treats me with respect and doesn't invade my privacy.Super mega slow... very late in the drive thru and inside not to mention","Positives:
- Always wonderful service and very nice professional people
- Drive thru is always fast

Room for Improvement:
- Lack of communication regarding branch closure and system downtime

- Easy appointment scheduling for opening new accounts

Don’t come here unless it’s your only option or you have time to spare.They are very short staff, expect long wait time, almost always there is only 1 teller in the front counter. Some tellers are extremely rude even if you greet with great hospitality but im sure it is the frustration and over whelming from being the only employee to help customers. Do better Wells Fargo.Worst bank ever.. please save your time and not go there. Kept me waiting, only to take in someone I came before. Horrible bankThis is absolutely the worst Wells Fargo in my opinion. Horrible management in my opinion of the way they run the waiting lines and handle the customers. I won’t be back again. The review ratings speak for themselves and I should have looked at that before walking in here today.Staff was entirely uninterested in helping me with my banking needs.  I am a current customer of 15 years.  Tried calling 2 other branches and couldn't get to a person before the automated service auto hung up on meWent in to open an account, had the pleasure of talking to Frances Chavez and I have to say...this is the best customer service I've ever received. Also, to add she treats everyone with great regard,respect, and courtesy. She is very knowledgeable in what she does...GREAT JOB FRANCES. THANK YOUThe slowest service you’ll ever receive inside lobby and drive  thru this is an on going problem even before the pandemic. Be prepared to hang out at the bank 30- 50 minutes for a quick deposit. It’s like there’s no teamwork to help the customers in a mannerTried to cash a check in the lobby long line only one cashier. Asked to use the restroom for my child was told no. But if you come back I can take you thru drive thru. Left came back. Went thru drive thru waited in that line -.- , was told I couldn't cash my check unless I went inside. Told the lady I was told they could help me since I told her what happened inside she said no I would have to go back inside to show 2 forms of id....ridiculous!!!!!! Glad I don't bank with Wells Fargo!!!!!!19 minutes to get money from my az account.in drive thru they sent the Carrier back n fourth 4×,I'm glad I changed banks they need retraining.

146,Wells Fargo Bank,"11039 Potranco Rd, San Antonio, TX 78251",San Antonio,"This branch discriminated against me because of my medical disability. Super embarrassing and frustrating.  It doesn't matter if I have two forms of identification I was refused service and wasn't explained why other than the system couldn't verify me.  But I was advise to go to one on the other side of town... (They EILL help me?) WowThere is at least one homeless person living on the premises, so be careful if using the ATM after hours.

Speaking of the ATM, I put my card and PIN number in and began to make a deposit. I put two checks in the machine, which did not process them or return them. It just took the two checks, failing to add that amount to my account. I called the bank as soon as they opened and was told that they can’t watch for my checks when they empty the ATM machine at the end of the day. I have to do a stop payment and ask the check writers to re-issue.

Member since 1988, but I will be closing my account because someone can’t be bothered to simply be on the lookout for two checks that their own machine took.Dear Wells Fargo, send Corporate to SHUT DOWN immediately this branch ASAP and FIRE every living soul that works here. Never experienced a Banker (young spanish guy) fight with a potential new customer, Horrible!! We took our money to Bank of America. BAD, BAD and BAD!.Whether the place is busy or not they take FOREVER I’ve came many times with it being one car and it being multiple cars THEY STILL TAKE FOREVER. Every time I’ve came I’m here for at least 30 minutes before I get helped AND they don’t go by order who got here first they will help all other lanes before they’ll get to me. Worst bank location ever.Everyone there was a joy to work with. Ana the banker there was awesome. I showed up to my appointment and did not realize I needed some paperwork, she allowed me to run home to get it and come back.  There was a bit of a wait but I appreciate being serviced so I did not have to take time off work during the week.

Earlier in the week I had taken time off work and went to 2 other branches and was rejected. So although the other two branches are closer to me, I will drive over to the Potranco location, anytime I need to go to a branch.Absolutely terrible. Rude.  Rude. Rude. Looking for a new banking institution. Done with WF.Been sitting here for 30 minutes no one acknowledge me to say hi or we will be right with you. Left and came back since I was early for my appt. Sarah the personal banker was done with her customer but still no acknowledgment had to go to the tellers and they said I have to wait on this one particular banker not Sarah which she was free and available and no customers were in line for the tellers.Giving me a hard time to withdraw a small amount of money! Smfh!!!!The worst they always make everything so difficult even I been dealing with this bank for years now they just don’t careFast n friendlyPlan on waiting forever. They staff 1 person at the front MAX.  This bank is such a joke….Terrible place doesn't even deserve 1 star!!!!!!!Worst experience ever from.a bankI have been a wells fargo customer for 15 years, this is my branch and they have always treated me very well.

147,Wells Fargo Bank,"11398 Bandera Rd Bldg 8, San Antonio, TX 78250",San Antonio,"Bandera Rd., San Antonio, TX...
A very rude teller at drive-thru today...27 April early afternoon.  I submitted a check for $1,350.00 to be cash and waited.  A young man appeared and told me to wait.  I waited for someone to ask  how I wanted the money to be arranged...crickets.  I continued to wait longer...finally an envelope landed in the capsule.  I asked the woman what is this?  In a rude manner, she said  it was  $1,350.00.  I said you should have asked how I wanted the money as is usual for any bank to ask.  Yes, she finally asked if I wanted it differently...she messed up to begin with.  She walked off her position and I left.
This is a systemic problem at this branch.  Banked with  Wells for thirty-five years in Houston five years ago where bank employees are professional and much better in so many ways.  This is the second time I have been dismissed by a drive thru teller at this bank.  Mind you, I avoid going to banks and do the vast majority of banking online.

You don't need to talk down to a seventy-seven year old man who fought in Vietnam and Cambodia for you.  Do your job in a professional manner if you can.  Where is management?1 Teller.  2 at the Drive Thru Windows.  Bank minimally staffed, perhaps due to Covid?  A 20 minute wait- for the sole customer in front of me.  I've always had excellent service at  this Bank, this was my 1st visit to this location.I was there to get help, because I didn't understand some things.
I get to the bank and was no one costumer there only me and I ask for help to the bank employee lady and she looked for excuses and didn't helped me.
I go out so disappointed.This bank ceases to amaze me. The customer service, banking services, mobile app, ATM, and everything else are PERFECT. I stop by a different one each time, and leave with the same satisfaction. They are also located EVERYWHERE, stay woke my friends 👁 …Wish there was an option to give Zero star for the pathetic customer service this branch and Wellsfargo provides. Not only they don't care for customers but they are not knowledgeable as well in there own processes. I walked in to the branch and I was told the bankers are not available and to book an appointment. If that's the case then why keep a branch....One of the most inconsiderate banks I have ever bank with I have been with them 25 plus years and they always find a reason to overdraft me I would have assumed that during the pandemic that they may be more considerate being that people are out of work or to sick to get out to bank like I was this week not once has my account not been brought current immediately they have changed the deposit policy immensely over the years loyalty means nothing here extremely disappointingI went on 12/30 (nobody else was with the banker) to open an account was told to come back on the 1/4.  So went to bank of AmericaWent to deposit and to get some change back and got wrong change back please count your money before you drive offLove my bank!  Very friendly and helpful team!It's a nightmare to be served here.....I was in front of the door and the employees looked at me and kept talking on the phone...even with an appointment they don't open the door and I ignore their customers.....not even a piece of paper in front of me of the door explaining why they don't let in horrible customer service.

It is a nightmare to be treated here ..... I was in front of the door and the employees looked at me and kept talking on his personal phone ... even with an appointment they do not open the door and they ignore their clients ..... not even paper in front of the door explaining why they don't let you in.

148,Wells Fargo Bank,"20826 U.S. Hwy 281 N, San Antonio, TX 78258",San Antonio,"Waited in line for 30 min only to be told that a banker was not available by the manager on duty. States they are in the process of hiring and "" JUST SO I KNOW""  a banker needs to handle my transaction. This is the only location open in this area. Always run into issues with this bank but this tops the cake. Never felt more unwelcome in a place of business before. Thanks to Ariel horrible experience.Ariel and her staff have fantastic customer service. They went above and beyond to try to help me with a frustrating situation. I had been trying to close my account with Wells Fargo for a year and every time I call the 1-800 number I’ve gotten the runaround. I spent 6 long and tireless hours at this branch and the poor staff was at the mercy of the 1-800 call center to help me. I went into the branch to try and get direct help but of course corporate America — they had to go to someone above them, above them, and above them. Ariel finally was able to close my account for me. Although I absolutely hate Wells Fargo and their way of banking- the staff here deserved my 5 star review as they watched me cry and plead for help in their lobby for hours. Thank you for your help. Wells Fargo branch -5 stars …. Wells Fargo corporate - 0 stars.5 stars for the tellers of this bank and 1 star for Wells Fargo for understaffing this branch. I come in often and a couple of weeks ago, there were only two people working at this bank. Wells Fargo needs to hire more tellers so the tellers that are working here are not overworked as they are now. The staff here are very friendly and will help you with your banking needs.No service here. No one to talk to about your account unless reserve apt 2 weeks out and only one teller. Had to call customer service line and told to go to bank. Closing huge savings avvoun asapDon’t even think about going to this location if you need any assistance, other than depositing or withdrawing your money. Because they will have one solution for all your questions ( call our helpline number)
Any yes their banker is on lunch all day long, no matter what time of the day you visit this location at.Been a customer with Wells Fargo (through acquisitions) for a good 25 years. Went to open a bank account for my son to give him the ""banking experience"". Exact similar experience as another reviewer in the reviews. There were 3 clerks, no single customer in the bank except us. When I asked if we could open an account for him, they all looked at each other then one guy asked another lady to open it and she replied I cannot.. not today.. And I thought that banks wanted new accounts.. I wish we had the Customer Service but maybe will try my luck at another branch to see if they want to open it. I only wanted to open it cause it would be easier to transfer money. Maybe I should move my account to a credit union to get a better serviceI’ve been here a couple times and there is always only one teller takes 30+ min. If you are in a hurry go somewhere elseCustomer service is a joke. I wanted to open an account with them.  Bank has only one customer there, there are two clerks and who I believe is the manager waiting...he asked ""can I help you""... sure I want to open an account! He's response was ""I have all my day booked."" Lol, no wonder why there are not many customers there. Went to the Bank of America nextdoor, great service!Zach was awesome in helping me get set up with my company card. I really appreciated how he did not let me do a transaction without a photo of my id. Although I did have to make a second trip to complete my business so that I could have my id with me I appreciated it. It really showed his values in following protocol, and he had a great personality.Horrible service. Went in and they only had 1 teller working and a greeter pacing back and forth with a line of customers.
Then they placed a hold on my security service official check due to a contract they have with them where they have to place checks of theirs on hold. That is what the teller Crystal said. Will definitely be changing banks.The staff here are very friendly and will help you with your banking needs.This location gives the worst customer service. They always give me issues and I have never had good experience with any of the employees!!! I was literally at the door at 12 and couldn't help me when had two people already helping inside. The whole staff needs to be worked with on how they treat the people that put money in bank. This is ridiculous its a Saturday and my store won't have money for the rest of weekend. Thank you for making my weekend ten times longer.No bankers today.  Why are you even open.  Close this bank down.Always a 15 to 30 minute wait at drive through!!  AlwaysWorst branch I have ever been toIF YOU NEED A BANKER TO OPEN AN ACCOUNT, SEND MONEY TO ANOTHER COUNTRY ETC, GO TO CARLOS ARAGONES HE IS VERY VERY KIND 👍😃 HE SIMPLY HELPED US WITH EVERYTHING WE NEEDED, IT'S GOOD THAT WELLS FARGO HAS PEOPLE THIS KIND AND TRAINED 10/ 10 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️","Positives:

I will visit this location againThis location has a lot of work to do with their employees. All I wanted to do today is deposit checks into my account and the lady upfront needed approval, so she wanted to verify my ID and then wanted to send me a text message for verification. Then needed management to come over to her computer and do an approval. It’s the only Wells Fargo bank that does the steps that are so unnecessary. I’ve been with Wells Fargo for seven years and I’ve had conversations with the general manager about previous issues for the same thing they take forever to do any type of transaction here. I’ve given this location for different chances and they can’t seem to get their act together and know what’s going on.Great location. It is a smaller branch with limited staff so sometimes there is a wait during peak hours. The Staff are great thanks to Jason, Nadia and Daniella  for always helping us.Came in to close my account today and suddenly they weren't in the mood to be very helpful. After being told to sit down for a Personal Banker to assist to close, multiple employees passed by with zero acknowledgement.

If the system allows you to.Excellent customer service. My debit card was stolen and wells fargo stopped the thief from stealing money I worked hard for. They also ordered me a new card and were extremely supportive. I highly recommend them.I came here to get my documents notarized and they I formed me as of last month they only notarize for Wells Fargo customers or non Wells Fargo customers that has a Wells Fargo document.

We so appreciate it!I went there at one point to get some cash out since i couldn't find my card in my house. Brought my ID and everything. And the guy at the desk for the first time in my life says i need two forms of ID to get money out. He takes my state drivers license anyways and asks about my card. I should have lied or just not talked to him because after telling him my card is lost INSIDE MY OWN HOUSE and i just was in a hurry and didn't want to look for it my card is no longer tied to my account and i have no way to access my money outside of bank hours. Will have to talk about this man because i do not think thats appropriate. 2 stars for the fantastic girl who handled me the next time though, if everyone else is like her maybe i'll actually use the wells fargo by my house.Promt greeting and prompt service. Jacob took the time to sit with and explain necessary information as a new business  prospect; very thorough and knowledgeable in that area thank you.Garbage customer service.  Not much more to say.  Sitting here waiting for my cash deposit To go through…. And it is taking 20+ minutes.  I know, employees are tough to come by, but this is ridiculousExcellent customer service Lawrence k.help me at this branch very pleasant answer all my questions always smiling will definitely go back to him for all my banking needs thanks again for great service.Excellent customer serviceThey always have atm problems and I have to go to cibolo.Never go back to this robot bank.

151,Wells Fargo Bank,"6839 US Hwy 87 E, China Grove, TX 78263",San Antonio,"Been here twice and it was drive thru only. Really hard to conduct your business via drive thru. And the drive thru is ridiculously slow. Why even stay open if you can't conduct business like a normal bank? Very disappointedI can’t get anybody to answer the phone at this branch. The generic 800 number is automated without a chance to talk to a natural person. Since I think my account is compromised, maybe I should go there and close all my accounts. But wait, I think I need to make an appointment over the phone before going there. Back to square one. I will probably get an automated response to this message about how sorry they are for my inconvenience. Perhaps a locally based credit union may be able to serve us better. Who knows.Pleasant location. There was a line but the wait wasn't long at all. Not a current member but was services in a polite manner. Location is quaint with various tellers available for service. Thank you.Do not come on Saturday. This bank closes its doors 10 minutes early to make sure they are out 10 minutes past closing time. Never had any issues with other locationsEasy drive thru ATMThe machine is processing fast40 minutes waiting and then 20 minutes before closing he told me that he couldn't serve me because they were going to close, when he was already the last one to attend, terrible service 👎","Positives:

152,Chase Bank,"13939 Nacogdoches Rd, San Antonio, TX 78217",San Antonio,"Ordered new card, due to unfair circumstances. (Theft!) Manager was able to expedite a new card with no fee at a different location. I came to this location to order A NEW ONE because the chip, nor swiping works, and I have to pay in order to get it expedited. Why do we play with lives like this? I hope the employees here have access to their money and can put food on their tables because I have to wait 5-7 days to be able to say that for me and my son. Thanks for your little to no help. I should have just called! 🫡 It is evident everyone is doing the minimum to help customers, starting with the manager. As long as we all get paid right! 😆I visited this branch and had a wonderful experience. Carlos helped my partner and I open a joint checking and savings account together. He truly went above and beyond to get us completely taken care of that day so we didn’t have to come back next weekend, even staying late a few minutes after closing. This is the kind of customer see code that has kept me a chase client for so long and is why my partner is switching over to chase as well. Thank you Carlos!Absolutely horrible bank!  My father died and per his lawyer I have literally everything I need to manage his affairs.  This bank refuses to acknowledge my paperwork and is literally holding my mothers funds hostage while claiming we don’t have what’s needed.  I think I believe a lawyer who’s been in practice for over 20years and a friend who went to a different bank with the same documentation after their mother died, over these crooks!  DO NOT BANK HERE!I checked my account last night to see my last deposit in Feb’23. I needed the amount of that deposit. Today I received a check and went to deposit it and the account is closed! I was told closed due to inactivity. I said it’s been less than two months that I haven’t used the account. It’s for a specific contractor to pay new easily. I was told it’s up to them and they don’t have to give any notice! They said I could simply go on the app and open another account. I need to deposit this check and use my debit card! I said give me my check back. I’ll take it to one of my two other banks I can trust. Chase just rose to the top of the worst banks I’ve ever experienced.Good luck getting assistance at the branch. Dropped off Power Of Attorney papers to be scanned and sent to legal. Tried several times to get a response from branch that it was completed and also make follow up appointment for a card. No answer for several days.This companies policies and customer service are terrorizing, shameful, anxiety inducing and the absolute worst!  I wouldn’t be surprised if dealing with their ridiculous and traumatizing behavior has given some of their customers heart attacks!I visited this branch today and had a great experience.  April took the time to help me and escalated my concerns.  The manager was also very helpful and I totally appreciate it.  I felt like I was heard and felt welcomed.  Awesome customer service!  I recently had a bad experience at another branch, so I had to highlight this great experience.Wanted to open an account and the teller said I needed an appointment to open one. I opened an account simple and easy online by myself afterwards. Do your employees not know simple information, and why would you need an appointment for something so simple anyways.Feels like there always slow.  Their ATMs are out of order most of the time. It's like why even be there.  And they usually say ""I may be ur personal banker"" but they don't keep the workers at the bank long enough for u to know them, yet alone trust them. Or they ask ""what may we do for u to make us ur 1st bank?"" They can't. So those r only a few reasons I dropped chase.Very disappointed in this branch’s customer service. It was not even that busy when I walked in. I walked in hoping to get assistance in opening up a checking account and I was completely ignored from the moment I walked in, I stood there and waited to be acknowledged, about 5-10 minutes went by before a man that had been on the phone acknowledged me,  just to tell me  to open up the account myself because it would be faster.I got the feeling he just didn’t want to help me for whatever reason so I left.Walked in and I'm the only customer. See 5 employees, they said none of them could help me change my name on my account and I would have to schedule an appointment. Apparently they were too busy with the rest of the invisible customers to help me today. Soonest appointment is two weeks away. What the heck are these people being paid to do? They were just sitting around talking and on their phones.Tried scheduling an appointment with Carlos to switch business bank accounts. When he called me he acted like he was too busy and said I was lucky I got the appointment when I did because he’s so booked. Then carrying on the conversation trying to get the details I needed, his attitude was just like he didn’t care. Still do not have the questions I needed answered. Unprofessional and wouldn’t recommend this location.I withdrew a large amount of money from Chase and it appears that I was given 100.00 bill that is fake. I tried depositing my cash into a different account with a different bank and the ATM did not accept it. I tried to pay at a restaurant with it and they told me it was fake.  I just tried depositing back the same bill onto their Chase ATM and it’s not accepting it. Now I’m here waiting to see if the teller will be able to assist with this. This is ridiculous. How can a bank miss this??? It just doesn’t make sense.Walked in to open a new business account was told they couldn’t see me and I would need to schedule an appointment for a later timeAngeles did an awesome job helping me today.  She worked very hard to make sure everything was done correctly.  Thank you for your helpThe staff On the phone or somewhat clueless. However, the staff in the branch made up for it in their efficiency and focus to get our tasks completed quickly.More tellers please. Looks like 1 teller runs all 3 lanes?Fast serviceWorst bank ever, would not recommend","Positives:

153,Chase Bank,"4011 San Pedro Ave, San Antonio, TX 78212",San Antonio,"Complete incompetence. Was told by customer service I had to visit a branch in person as I was having trouble opening an IRA account on-line. Was greeted by Joshua  - who inspite of having a clipboard failed to write down my name or why I was there. After 15 minutes (I was on my lunch hour), I ask how much longer? He asks me why was I there again? Then he disappears and returns informing me the financial advisor wasn't available today. I told him I didn't need a financial advisor; it was just a profile update on the records. He didn't get it. He tried selling me an appointment for tomorrow which would have been Aug 22. Good grief. Went to the branch closest to home which I should have done in the first place.Talked to Joshua and he said he would help my elderly mother. He was sitting down while she was standing up trying to follow what he was saying because they won't help customers to open an account after 4:20 pm. Stick to the ATM and if you need to do something I would strongly suggest you do it using your computer at home.My Id card is expired &
Having said that, the gentleman who,I wish I could remember his name. After Asking for another form of ID , he actually went and withdrew the amount I've money I had requested from my account. I believe he went above and beyond his duty as an employee of Chase. Kindness is alive and well at Chase Bank Olmos Park !!!Possibly I'm in the minority here: people who are not comfortable doing their business in a denominational bank. Not comfortable receiving blessings from staff when i visit. I've actually held off visiting till Saturday, when i can, when there seems to be a more secular staff on dutyI've been banking at Chase for only about 4-5 years later had any problems The tellers are very professionalSo happy with our experience with Kiana today! Kiana went above and beyond to help my little brother open his first account. She was so helpful and so personable, we are so grateful for her!!Had someone wrote $3,500 wroth of fake checks against my business account. They used the online mobile app to steal from my business account. It was a another chase member. Even though is was a chase check, with a chase app by a chase member, I was told I still cant get my money back. The checks where badly written with one check even having the word ""Void"" it and I still cant get my money back. I am moving my account to frost or Jefferson back where they can bring more security to a business bank account. Don't use chase for a business bank account. The mobile app they have can be use to easily take money from your account.This bank has horrible customer service, I’ve been making cash deposits for my job everyday for almost a year. That being said I was told by one of the tellers at the drive thru that they recognize me since I’ve been consistently making deposits everyday an I would no longer go to provide my ID. Fast forward I’m trying to make a deposit with these same people however they’re being audited so now they asked for my ID which I didn’t have on me at the time they wouldn’t even accept a picture either, manager was unwilling to help the situation at all I would personally never bank here. Why tell your customer one thing an turn around an do another.The ATM never work, they have two and neither one of them work properly. It’s very frustrating to have to drive to other locations to deposit. I’ve been banking here for over 20 yrs but this is ridiculous, I don’t have much of a choice I may have to look else where to bank if this issue is not addressed.Had a great experience with Kiana today. She was so sweet and super helpful. We got everything we needed done in a timely manner.Around a few years ago. I was a victim of fraud. It was around 3,000. I asked the chase bank if they could do anything. Point me in the right direction. Who to call and so forth. None of the bankers and tellers helped me. I ended up speaking to the manager and he simply said ""sorry. There's nothing we can do""
In the end I never got my money back.So i used to work for this bad location 5 yrs ago. I know thats a long time to wait for a review but none the less its here. I used to be a Personal Bnker at that locatiin and it was the worst decision I have ever made working for this trash compamy. Not sure if he is still there but Moses the branch manager is a patheic reason of a manager. The only thing he did for me was to motivate me in leaving the bank. I'm thankful that I found a real bank to work for and which allows me to become a real personal banker for my customers.I have used Chase Bank from 2009. It provides extremely helpful and useful services for disabled veterans. Too many to list here. Whether on line, App, on phone, or in person my experience is successful and am treated by courteous and friendly bank employees. Very well trained professionals.Went to open an account, I have to have  an appointment to open an account I can’t believe that they cannot take me till Monday today is Tuesday. It’s ridiculous you have to wait six days to get an appointment ..appointment to open an account ridiculous and it’s not acceptable.ATM machines are always broken 😡 …Make sense the bad reviews (0 star)The ATMs don't work, the machine grabbed my deposit, the cash was stuck and the number they gave me they never respond, they are very despotic, they don't care about the customers, very bad service, they still haven't given me my cash and I had bills to pay for that, so the deposit very bad serviceThey are only cashiersExcellent service","Positives:

154,Chase Bank,"815 Evans Rd, San Antonio, TX 78258",San Antonio,"Branch poor customer service tellers, bankers and even the vice president horrible, horrible man. He is aggressive and rude has not idea how to do the first thing which is customer service. It is well known employees behave the same way as their leader and undeniably this is the case. They should go to a bigger city to be teach some manners and a professional attitude.Had one of the worst experiences opening a business checking account about a month ago. Various mistakes on their part led to wasted hours for me and my partner. Banker even ignored my request to speak to the manager (though he left a VM right before they closed later that day). Wasn't going to write this review despite everything, but I just got charged a lame service fee even though the banker said a minimum balance was not required in the first month. Maybe not their fault, but do yourself a favor and avoid this branch. I would have just deposited the money right away had I known there would be a service fee in the first month after opening.Made an appointment online and when I walked in was immediately greeted. I only waited a few minutes and then met with Mrs. Martinez whom was super polite and helped me with what I needed.Why have a phone number if you are never going to answer it?Nice associate's.

I received the worst treatment in this branch when I asked them for some information about my personal account. I was greeted by a woman who, before I spoke, seemed angry and refused to fill out the form that I requested. She said that you must send it to us by fax. When I went to another branch, I found a very warm welcome from the receptionist. His gentle smile almost made me forget the mistreatment I suffered in this branchBad customer service, the ladies in this bank need better training on how to better serve customers. I hate going inside the bank they make me feel uncomfortable. I rather go through the drive through to avoid the staff.Rude as hell cashiers were really interested about talking about their personal lives rather than tend to customers. So ghetto never coming back.Almost all the time the Atm here is broken and I tried to go inside today around 2pm and surprise!! the bank was closed when it supposed to be open according their hours! I live 4 blocks away from here and most of the time I have to go look for another atm because same problem here yall should take care of it and your customers! It's really anoying!Didi Brown the Branch Manager a phenomenal person and understands customer needs very nicely. She went above and beyond to help us out in getting our banking needs taken care of by being patient and willing to help us out.A wonderful person she is kudos and she is an asset to the chase bank.Impossible to get through on the phone. I was trying to get a notary, couldn't get through on the phone, so I went in, but you have to have an appt and the next one wasn't for about 2 wks. I only had my account for maybe 4 months when I decided I'd prefer to bank elsewhere (they're slow on deposits too). I opened it under one of their promotions, so I called customer service to ask if there was a time requirement for how long I had to have the account open under that promotion before they would say I owed them money or something like that. They told me there wasn't. So I  went to the branch and told the teller I wanted to withdraw my balance and close the account. He closed the account and wouldn't give me my money. It was only $3, but that's not the point. When he closed it he said it was showing a $0 balance and he didn't know why so he told me to call customer service. They told me it was because of the promotion and I had closed the account too early but they couldn't see the terms so they couldn't tell me what exactly the time requirement was. I told them I called Chase customer service and they told me there was no time requirement. They told me I should have read the fine print when I opened the account. I told them if they, Chase Bank, couldn't see their own terms, how was I supposed to? The lady on the phone was rude. The guy at the branch was clueless. We like Frost Bank way better.Incredible office led by branch manager Didi!  They have a greeter team that makes it welcoming.

Quick service to deposit coins, and we were helped  immediately by Leo to sort out the $25 monthly charge and was reassured that he would try to get refunds on all previous charges. I originally planned to close all accounts with Chase because of the $25 monthly fees, but because it was sorted out, we ended up keeping them open. Plus, we were able to receive 1 refund immediately with 2 pending. Overall, I'm surprised by the effort to sort it all out.They are so rude! They do not acknowledge you when you’re there waiting and when you bring it to their attention they get offended. One bad Apple ruins the bunchI had an experience today involving a large deposit that had gone missing. I was going an hour 6 of trying to resolve this issue driving from branch to branch and had almost given up. I went to the Alamo Ranch location and finally found two ladies that went above and beyond to help me. I just wanted to personally say thank you to Crystal and Melinda for all their hard work helping me resolve this issue.Frist time doing a wire transfer, Alexis was very helpful! From the moment I walked in I was greeted and didn't have to wait long. Love their new process in depositing my money (inside). Great location <3 <3I wish I can give the 0 , worst costumer service I ever deal with. They are racist. All the workers are Mexicans and I was waiting for more than 30min then 3 Mexicans lady’s coming in and they serve them and when I asked the guy there , he didn’t answer and he said i  need to wait for at least 40min moreI've been in a lot of Chase bank locations, but this one here is the worst. customers service dosen't exists. Rude staff from the door. Very disappointed and thinking of changing my bank and taking my business somewhere else.Today, as well as 19 months ago, tried this chase to get t47 notorized and here we are again going to UPS because these people offer the extra services but can never uphold them. Same task less than 2 years later....The ATM just took my $1100 cash deposit and all of a sudden started malfunctioning and displayed a 1800 number to call to ensure that my deposit was made (I immediately logged in into my online account and it doesn’t show the deposit   , I walked in the lobby and they said there is nothing they can do to help that I just have to call the 1800 number  ,
So I called  they said that they are just going to start an investigation , and they will contact me but meanwhile I don’t have my money  definitely not a reliable ATM systemAt least one of the ATMs isn’t working at all times. It’s been at least 2 months since one of them is on some sort of log in screen. Not very reliable ATMS.This was my go to bank unit they opened one up in Alamo Ranch.  These folks  helped me with a bunch of papers that needed notarizing - nice peopleThey now want to charge $25 per month to have a checking account with them....🤬. …Very friendly & quick service.really zero stars DO NOT BANK WITH CHASEPlease Bank else where.

161,Chase Bank,"707 Bandera Rd, San Antonio, TX 78228",San Antonio,"Had someone wrote $3,500 wroth of fake checks against my business account. They used the online mobile app to steal from my business account. It was a another chase member. Even though is was a chase check, with a chase app by a chase member, I was told I still cant get my money back. The checks where badly written with one check even having the word ""Void"" it and I still cant get my money back. I am moving my account to frost or Jefferson back where they can bring more security to a business bank account. Don't use chase for a business bank account. The mobile app they have can be use to easily take money from your account.Just keep driving to the next branch. No customer service here.You can't keep your money here.
I haven't used it in a few years, but was notified that I was under $50 dollars.  Didn't understand, since I never used that account.  Now, later I'm told it's in the minus.  Chase has been stealing my money for putting my money in their bank.  And still didn't stop billing me when they took my last cent.  Now, I owe them money for stealing my money.  Corporations in America really have no moral justice to their customers 😲. Dishonesty, to take your last cent and make you pay for it double... Corporations ruined this country with greed.  Put your money in a Credit Union, they at least won't take your money if you let it sit there.  Greedy banks do take your money.  Why do people accept how greedy corporations take people money.  Stop doing business with them.The worst place. Manager was browsing things on internet while pretending to be in phone meeting. I wanted to open a business account and the guy told me it will take minimum two hours. I was like what? I have all the docs you need. He said I am new and my manager will have to sit with me to open it. Also, I have another appointment in few minutes so schedule tomorrow.
They didn't have even another person to help people. Another lady who dressed poorly was running around printing. Seemed like she jumped right out of bed.
I looked around and the branch is a mess. I hope someone from corporate takes a notice and brings a change.I had to wait for my mom and most of the time I was just a physical presence that accompanied  her, even  though I think I do play a role being the beneficiary  of her account.Went to make a payment and nobody knows how their services workVery happy with this branch, the staff was very helpful expecially mr. Hector. Glad doing business in the future with Chase Bank.ATMs are always broken here. Very inconvenient. This will be the reason I end up leaving chase .Don't waste your time.  They closed the bankIs this bank open or not?! Update Google please!Excellent staff and service","Positives:

According to chase if you don't have a chase account and you have a check from someone else that he ownsa chase acc. It's not enough for them to cash your check this bank sacksWe had a female teller who's name read Frenzy on her name tag. She was awesome! Very friendly and talkative asking how are day was going. Chase Bank needs more employees like her working for them. This was the South Park location.They are nice but I'm going to find me another bankAll 3 ATMs are down for weeks now at this branch. Drive through is slow as molasses just to withdraw from your account. Nice customer service hence the 2 stars.I guess I time my visits just right or I get lucky because each time I go there isn't too bad of a wait and there are representatives waiting as soon as you walk in.Nice little bank inside Southpark Mall.
Staff is nice.I don’t recommend chase bank to anyone if I could rate -0 I would it has been the worst experience ever. I deposit a check last month and there was a mistake now chase is keeping the funds and I can’t do anything about it so there basically keeping my money and none of the employees know anything thing please think twice before signing up with chase bank no good all around.never any parking and there's time they take way to longYes everything may be true the long line few bankers but I see nothing wrong I don't mind waiting I rather get it right and wait then rush and get everything misunderstoodMULTIPLE ATMs out all the time . Currently only 1 of 4 outside ATMs work and the line is always super long because of this.Horrible bank.  Always screwing the customer over.  Customer service doesnt exist here whatsoever.  Your money isnt safe.  They are always siding with big buisnesses to rip you off.I had a small hundred dollar check given to me as an appreciation I went to cash it at Chase bank I do not bank with them but they felt that it was suitable to charge $10 to cash one of their own checks I don’t know they just seems obsessive and it should be illegal like they don’t get enough of our money they got to find ways to steal more of it it’s just ridiculousWaste of time,  Notary lady has no clue about notarizingMrs. Josie Mojica thank you for your excellent customer service.Great customer service, miss Reyna help me out, with all my cuestions.All 4 atms are broken.

163,Chase Bank,"5258 De Zavala Rd, San Antonio, TX 78249",San Antonio,"The person with whom I opened my account, in front of the Walmart near Mainland, was nice, but I have called & been transferred MANY TIMES when I had a question regarding my brokerage account, & when I went inside, at the one closer to Bandera & 1604, I almost had the sense that they were TRYING to destabilize my mind. I do believe that Jamie Dimon is a patriot, though, as he said in his interview in China. Also, I have never  been charged a $50 fee, or anything like that, like I did on another well-known, well-respected brokerage. I don't think I've ever actualy gone inside the Chase branch office on De Zavala. I used their drive-thru for information, but was able to get my husband to go inside to deposit funds, after I explained my ordeal at the one on Bandera & 1604 ( where the guy called one of his friends to talk to me, after I wasn't understanding his answer).
I've kept my account at Chase open, because they will let you buy stocks that Robinhood doesn't have, for FREE, when TD Ameritrade wanted to charge $5-7. Charles Schwab can also be pricey. Particularly with Scwab, READ ALL THOSE NOTES: 1), 2), 3), 4), etc. That's where I was charged $50 for a penny lithium stock. I had read that they once helped this woman out of her expensive options service, but Schwab made no comment when I asked if they really had to charge me $50. They give you all those notes, & they expect you to read them!
Chase has recently added extra information on the stocks you purchase, below the ""BUY"" button, I think. I haven't looked at it, much, because my stocks are just so Shockingly Down, right now, on Chase, & I don't have a lot of extra $. It might prove very useful, though.
The best thing about the Chase branch on De Zavala is the landscaping. You can get a potato taco next door, at Bill Miller, and enjoy a few moments under a very shady palm +other trees, at Chase, watching the cars go by, at a very busy intersection. I once wrote Jim Cramer that I don't know how people in San Antonio buy TSLA, when I never see them, even though the dealership is not that far away. I can't say that, anymore. If you sit at the Chase on De Zavala & I-10, you'll probably see a Tesla go by, even in the first 15-20 minutes.My cashapp was hacked and $600 was took from my bank account. I then came to the bank closed that account and opened a new one . Today 2 months later the $609 was taken out of my NEW ACCOUNT. This is not right . What is the point of disputing a charge and having o get a new card if you guys will just steal back the $600 that was reverted to me to begin with. I was told this would not happen and could not happen but it did . Now I’m going remove all of my money out of my account I wouldn’t recommend then  if I was paid too. Not to mention the ATMS are always broken . -10/10 very disappointedThank you to Matthew Sowell for helping me set my new account & taking your time to guide me. I appreciate you and the lady staff who greeted me as well.Really appreciated the $200 bonus when I created my new checking account with them. Very helpful and friendly staff every time I come in. Thank you!After 25 years of banking with Chase I have closed down my account due to the way I was treated last Friday by their staff all I needed was to do opening a new bank account for my son they weren't willing to help in any way. They said it was only through appointment. There was 4 bank workers if you can
Call them that.there no customers but one at the teller all 3 .  They would not even help me set up an appointment to open up a bank account let alone try to open up the bank account at that time.Last week I was on the phone with the customer service department for 2:23+ minutes. Then again another 2 hours and some minutes another day. The reps didn't even help me with what I needed! Chase has the worse customer service (over the phone). They need to do something about it. Because just because of that I feel like banking with some other company.Carrie and Cris without an H we’re extremely helpful advocates of chase bank. I had been having problems with the app and online trouble shoots so I went in person to the dezavala location. Carrie went above and beyond to make sure my every need was handled and did it with the most positive and caring attitude. Cris handled my transactions personally and professionally doing everything he could to make sure I got the information and transactions I needed handled to the tee. These two employees go above and beyond to care for the chase customers that come into the dezavala location. You can tell these two apart when you walk through just from their smile and greeting at the door. Thanks for taking care of a very satisfied chase customer. Definitely the best location in town!Horrible wait time. What took Bank of America 5 minutes to accomplish, it took 2 hours at chase. No wonder they barely have any customers, versus a big, fast moving line at BOALast 3 days I've been calling I having issue online log in the block my account and been calling to fix it they keep hanging up on me Really bad customer serviceHorrible customer service! I have never had such a bad experience with a bank! They steal your money.On March 1st I deposit my paycheck when I looked at my receipt Chase bank deposit $70,000 in my account by mistake that night I called at 800 number and we started the process to return the money back to my employer ...long process... employees at Chase Bank employees try to help me but unfortunately they need more training and they inform me that they are  limited to certain information on my account all they kept telling me at the bank was to call the 800 number which I did I had difficult understanding them due to their heavy accent  on March 10th Chase Bank reassured me that everything was fine my employer receives his $70,000 back but my payroll check from March 1st will be held until March 18th I understood I was reassured that everything was back to normal with my account so I thought on March 15th I deposit my payroll check at the same bank to find out they put a hold on that check as well and it will not be released until March 24th as well I called the 800 number and they told me that every time I deposit a check from my employer it will be put on hold I informed her why it was never put on hold before she told me I'm sorry for the inconvenience I informed her how convenient at Chase Bank and you can just brush me off and make me feel that it was my mistake Chase bank has not apologize and none of their employees have ever apologized to me all they ever did was make me feel like a criminal ..... Chase Bank make the mistake and put $70,000 in my Account  I didn't ...The new guy Matt was AWESOME. Welcone to SA Matt.

Been waiting 10 mins already at the drive thru and not even spoken to yet.
It’s not the employees fault they don’t staff properly, so I’m not going to fuss at them.
Do better ChaseTellers are ALWAYS rude and treat you like you’re doing something unscrupulous when you’re just trying to cash a check or doing anything else at this branch.  Probably the worst bank experience ive ever had is at this branch, and ive been to multiple Chase branches.  i wish I lived closer to another one.Very happy with Chase in general.  Long time customer with a very positive experience.Clean well knowledge bank , great customer serviceThe worse bank ever. They are so quick to take your money but when they owe you, you have to wait. Customer service is horrible everyone hates their job. ATMs never work. Tellers are rude. Vice president is rude. They don't care about your money. Bank of America is waaaayyy better. Chase deserves NO starsBusiness account and have to wait forever for assistance. Only car in drive thru but now sitting over 30 minutes because any customer coming in after me take priority.. absolutely ridiculous. Very frustrating when it takes a teller an hour to do my deposits. If your short staffed, hire people.🤨 …Before closing this was my go to bank, men was courteous. No I had very bad experience rep is rude do follow directions and takes forever for a small transaction I will go back to Alamo Ranch this place needs reconstruction overallI was nervous coming in, considering all the bad reviews.

I recommend Banco Las Américas, or Well Fargo, there are many. There are more options than putting the noose around your neck.

165,Chase Bank,"7559 Northwest Loop 410, San Antonio, TX 78245",San Antonio,"Chase atms STAY down, it’s a major inconvenience especially when Im rarely off work before they close. It’s so annoying to have to drive around San Antonio to find a working atm. The lights on the atms that don’t work are never off so you never know it doesn’t work until you’re right up on it. They go days sometimes weeks at a time with atms that don’t work & im sick of it. Definitely won’t be with chase much longerNo one at the physical office answering the phone. One of the largest banks in the world can't have customer service available to paying customers. I can get anyone at a credit union on the phone with one call.What in the world is up with your slow service… you hire a bunch of people who take their  sweet time . I get it worked with money critical but teach your people to be efficiently faster. Omg the worst banks to be at.It’s not surprising that this location has a 2.5 google rating.

Customer service is anemic, employee knowledge is abhorrent, speed of service is horrible and total experience is pathetic.

Definitely not returning to this location.Gerardo is an excellent banker, he went above and beyond to make sure all our questions were answered.How are you going to provide your customers check writing services but charge their payee $10 fee to cash it if they don’t have an account with you all. How is that ethical? You are conflicting with the services that you provide your customers and trying to push other non-customers to open accounts with you all so they can get a check cashed. Other places where they can cash the checks charge a lot less than that and their fees make sense to charge they are not the financial institution. Try not to end like Wells FargoI went in with my daughter to apply for her first credit card and the teller said we needed to go on-line to apply. She was very helpful and gave us all the details on how to apply. I previously had called the 800 number and they said we could apply on line or at the bank.
She didn't offer that option at the bank and I mentioned it to her. She went to speak to the banker and he met with us and took the credit card application. Mr. Rodriguez stated that we should have made an appointment but he would squeeze us in between his appointments. He was very helpful and gave my daughter all the information she needed to choose which credit card would work best for her. He had great customer service and put the customer first. Thank you!Mixed thoughts on the review. Monica, the branch manager, is awesome. She gets 10 stars. On a corporate level, Chase gets -10 stars. They are clueless on how to resolve urgent technical issues quickly. It took them several months to resolve problems. The branch itself is sometimes understaffed, which slows down the ever increasing long line.Horrible customer service. They have no clue I. How to manage the pressure of having a long line. Bank was short staffed. One employee explain one process and the other one was rude. Unable to speak to a manager. They need more training. Specially at setting right expectations and explaining business customers the process instead of pushing them to the side and helping everyone else.This bank is so so awful they never have change for my business or my deposit always wrong and the staff is rude.Just terrible that’s all I got to say don’t go to this branchI always insert money because of my business around 9pm or 10pm to deposit and the drive thru lanes never wanna work. Please Fix This Technical IssuesTellers are super slow! The need to hire more Tellers or add more drive up lines only has 1 drive up line this is RIDICULOUS! 😡 …Needed to get paperwork notarized and Zack Boothby was epic! Thank you so much for helping me today.$10 to cash $100 check and it was a chase checkQuick drive thru tellers.

I'm a business owner and all I need was $1s. I think this ridiculous and they should close this branch and just keep a ATM here. That's all this one is good for in the first place.

167,Chase Bank,"5801 Babcock Rd, San Antonio, TX 78240",San Antonio,"Alexis Garcia has provided excellent service. 11 out of 10Great experience, Ashley was very helpful and made everything easy for me!I accompanied my mother who had heart surgery to the bank for some paperwork to be filled out. We were not greated or helped. We were lied to by three people who kept passing us on to others. One lady flat out lied and went behind the locked door with the key pad and never returned. The first lady who was suppose to help us started making calls while customers... Us were inside in need of assistance. I do not recommend this branch. They have no clue what customer service is or to be human. I actually give them zero stars but get what can you do. They need humanity training and a clue.Absolute terrible wait times. Waiting in line in the drive thru for over half an hour and still 3rd in line. Not expecting a reply from corporate. Once these companies become so big; they're to good to respond to customer complaints and just brush them off. What a shame. Taking my business to another bank.HORRIBLE customer service. Slow ATM machines and if they aren’t slow they simply aren’t working. Has happened too many times for me to deposit $200+ for the machine to eat it, start having technical difficulties and I don’t receive that money until a month later. If it weren’t for this low quality location I wouldn’t have any problems with chase.Excellent customer service, banker Marie Sepulveda is amazing; courteous, professional and very knowledgeable. Thanks Marie, you made my day much easier by helping me with my requests.As soon as I walk in I hear an employee  telling customers they don’t offer the service they need and they need to go to another bank.

Now to my issue,  I own a company and got a check payment for a job from chase.* (Ive banked with before and I am NOT a fan of their customer service  )   I go and the teller was very sweet but obviously had to go through the same employee who was rude to the customers, literally said no without even looking that I had all the forms.  Then says we’ll we don’t know how many names are on the company,   Lady. I have the forms.  It’s just me!  Didn’t even bother to look and said no because you don’t have an account with us .   LoL. I wonder why!Excellent Service, people always smiling !!!I went to this location today and Oscar was able to assist me right away. He was very professional, courteous and efficient.Love this location all the employees are great I for got his name he has green eyes also another girl on her early 20 but one again all the employees are amazingRude  ladies that don’t remember their customers and make up fake policies I knew there was a reason I don’t use this bankWaiting time is too long. Only two people on office helping people.Don’t waste your time coming here seriously. Rude customer service, management non existent. Go somewhere else.The worst branch I have gone too!

168,Chase Bank,"1100 Goliad Rd, San Antonio, TX 78223",San Antonio,"I own a paving company, I received a $3600 check, I went into this chase bank drive through on goliad. They had me wait 20 minutes, finally when they sent the money through it was $53. I don’t usually check the envelope but luckily my wife did. I let them know they shorted me $3100. They had me wait longer, only to tell me they won’t let me get the money because it’s too much money unless I want to become a member. I will certainly not be using this bank or advice anyone else too.Disappointed in Chase. Opened an account for my parents. Had to come into a branch to add the additional spouse on to the account. This branch has one person and one person only who can do this. Appointments as far as a week out just to add someone on an account. Logical thing to do would be to train tellers to do basic stuff like this if you can adequately staff bankers. It’s a major inconvenience to your customers.Not good went to open a new account not even busy..can't help me with anything... customer service first..Worst location ever feel so bad for the business, went in to pay my rent spent an hour do to clueless cashier Clarissa didn’t know how to look up an account had the worst attitude ever, I was actually the one who stayed calmed an professional when it should of been vise versa, on top of that the “branch manager” was there an was just as clueless as that cashier girl, like dam I understand the manager is old an has a lot of time but i don’t I’m not old.Ms. Rascon helped me with my paperwork. Pleasant interaction and friendly staff. Happy to do bussiness with Chase.They don’t take cash deposit from a non account holder to an account holder. The people inside have about as much attitude as you’d expect from gutter trash.The drive through is the speed is horrible, and I'm in the business line... I even had to remind the girl after she gave me my change, where are my rolls of coins? She forgot...Great full service convenientNeeds better parkingGood helpfullGood service","Positives:
- Pleasant interaction and friendly staff
- Good service
- Convenient full-service bank
- Helpful staff
- Good customer service

Room for improvement:
- Long wait times in the drive-through
- Inconvenience of having to make appointments far in advance for simple tasks
- Lack of adequate staffing for basic services like adding a spouse to an account
- Cashiers with poor attitude and lack of knowledge
- Inability to take cash deposits from non-account holders

Miscellaneous:
- Shorted a customer on a check and refused to give them the full amount
- Disappointed in overall experience with the bank
- Issues with drive-through speed and forgetfulness of staff
- Need for better parking facilities."
169,Chase Bank,"22203 I-10, San Antonio, TX 78256",San Antonio,"Had a great experience setting up a new account at Chase today! The branch manager Angelic and banker Jose were beyond helpful and went out of their way to make my time there comfortable and enjoyable. Very personable and informative staff here!If I could rate  with zero stars I would.  I have been trying to close accounts for 2 weeks, they have all of the information they requested yet I can’t get anyone in the phone who can speak to my request.

I was told I would hear back in 24-48 hours!

I started in the branch, and moved to Caliing the 800 # and being transferred to the department that handles accounts of the deceased. They could see all of the paperwork was uploaded, but could not do anything for me.   The last thing I was told was I need to go into the branch, which is a minimum of 1 hour away from my home. I can go online to schedule an appointment. For the record I work for a living too!

And no, they cannot connect me to the branch whose direct line is always too busy to assist .  Not only will I be closing my uncles account my my Account will also be closed now.  Completely dissatisfied with one small acceptor , the people who do Handel the reporting of a death, they are super kind.Dominion Chase i hope you read this. I was going to open another business bank account. I walked in and sat down for an hour waiting which is fine because this was the way it has been done for years. However, when they finally called on me they said we’re sorry we have appointments and can’t see you. Ok, ive been here for 10 years and it was never done that way before. I didn’t even know i could make an appointment online. Chase, how about putting a sign in the waiting area that says, “now book appointments online” and show how to do it instead of having business people waste time in the waiting area. Honestly many of the Chase branches are now a ghost town as they try and move people more and more online with no face to face services. Im now considering a local credit union.The staff are nice here.  This review is not a reflection of the staff and management of this particular branch.

1)  Difficult to get here!  I blame this on whoever developed the corner lot.  There's only one direct turn-in for this branch going NE on stonewall pkwy and it's easily missed.  Once the turn-in is missed, it's super cumbersome to turn back around.  There is also no direct turn in from the I-10 frontage road. It's also hard to turn in from the CVS parking lot across the street.

2)  General Chase company policy:  Chase limits Quick Deposit (via online app) to daily amount of $7500 (at least for total checking account).   Not sure why the limit is not set at $10,000Call if you want to immediately access a neverending loop of phone tree fractals. Press whatever you want, but you will never reach a human. This branch has never been helpful as others have said. It's run like a utility company.Walked in with family to open an account. 9 staff members on there with no customers I mean zero customers. “We have nobody available right now but we can schedule an appointment for next week for you” we laughed and left. Oh ya somebody name Jimmy was the manager in charge. Never left his chair playing with his computer while we were thereThe worse chase bank in San Antonio. I’ve been a member since 2015. I have  a business and personal account. Every time I walk in I’m NEVER greeted. I’m literally standing in the middle of the bank confused on how service is just horrible.

Alamo Ranch, Potranco , and Bandera locations I walk in and instantly greeted and serviced. This location needs a turnaround. The only person that has class is the Chinese gentlemen everyone else has lost the sense of customer experience.

It’s not hard guys get it together.They don't respect your time. Bad management and rude employees.They answered my call once and put me on hold for about 30 min till the phone line dropped. Other times absolutely no answer. They’re my neighborhood bank so I would had putting up with them unless things are seriously bad. I would rather fighting the traffic and driving  to a different bank instead of dealing with this one in the Dominion.ATM has been broken for a long time. Fix it already. This is terrible. Don't come here","Positives:
- Staff at the branch manager and banker were helpful and informative
- The people who handle reporting of a death were kind
- Staff at other Chase branches (Alamo Ranch, Potranco, and Bandera) greeted and serviced customers promptly
- The Chinese gentlemen at this branch had good customer service

Room for improvement:
- Difficult to find the branch location
- Chase company policy limits Quick Deposit amount
- Difficulty reaching a human on the phone
- Staff at the branch did not have immediate availability to open an account

- Long waits on the phone and unresponsiveness from staff
- Broken ATM at the branch

Miscellaneous:
- Some customers were considering switching to a local credit union
- The branch location is a ghost town with fewer face-to-face services as Chase moves customers online"
170,Chase Bank,"1000 E Basse Rd, San Antonio, TX 78209",San Antonio,"Had someone wrote $3,500 wroth of fake checks against my business account. They used the online mobile app to steal from my business account. It was a another chase member. Even though is was a chase check, with a chase app by a chase member, I was told I still cant get my money back. The checks where badly written with one check even having the word ""Void"" it and I still cant get my money back. I am moving my account to frost or Jefferson back where they can bring more security to a business bank account. Don't use chase for a business bank account. The mobile app they have can be use to easily take money from your account.4 branches in the past 3 days all telling me they are too busy to help me open a checking account.. Highly recommend those reading this review to take your business an use another bank. Was told I'd get a call back to see when I can come in and nothing still... very disappointing..No 24/7 ATM access. Not very convenient Chase bank.Customer service is dead with chase they charge INSANE fees for EVERYTHING now not worth it i have a CHECKING SAVINGS sw airlines cc a freedom cc and a freedom unlimited cc and im canceling ALL OF THEM because they can't be bothered to answer the phone and tell me to how expensive the fees are WHEN THERE IS NO ONE IN THEIR STORE!!!All the Bankers are always so helpful and niceI don't like this bank.","Positives:

171,Chase Bank,"11983 Alamo Ranch Pkwy, San Antonio, TX 78253",San Antonio,"A complete waste of time. They don't have enough employees. We had to struggle for three days just to open an account and we failed. We made an appointment for the day and time when the banker would come and we came again, but this time the banker did not come to the bank. So we could not open our account and we lost an incredible amount of time.I had an appointment at 9am. I took my day off from work , i was there on time and ohhhh surprise the person in charge of the business accounts was absent so no one could help me. They cancel my appointment without a notification, so they offer another day , i said this Saturday cause i dont have more days off at work and they said ohh sorry this Saturday is fully booked 😡 are you serious??? What kind of bank is this???? I already hate them and I don’t even have a personal account with them lolI was unable to complete any of the banking actions I needed at this location as it only has one banker working on a Saturday and they have a “fully booked schedule.” Since when do you need an appointment to do simple transactions at the bank?Today I went to open a checking account and from the moment I went in I was welcomed and taken care off. The person that assisted me was Mike Aguirre and let me just say that his people skills, patience and work ethic is one of the best! From what I saw today, it seems that most of the workers there are more than happy to assist you with your needs.I have been a Chase Bank customer for going on 20 years and unlike other large institutions these folks do not act as if they are doing you a favor rather they give you good service which I have found I can always count on.Amazing place. The staff here are so kind and patient and I truly appreciate that. I usually come during the morning and there is either no line or a 1 person line. Some staff also speak Spanish which is an added bonus.Extremely rude and uninformed.  Looking forward to closing account on Monday.Nice people & manager that care about providing good serviceWouldn't let me change my account information. Looking for another bank and to close these accountsNot here!

173,Chase Bank,"14832 Jones Maltsberger Rd, San Antonio, TX 78247",San Antonio,"I just stopped in and had tons of questions about my credit card and the long process that I was kind of in a pickle with with my card and a gentleman named Chris Luna he helped me and he helped me figure out all of my mess within like 10 minutes. He was so helpful and totally understood the problem and came up with the solution really quick to get me on my way! Thank you again!I called this location to ask if they have a notary on site, and was told they have 3 and no appointment needed. I showed up a bit later, waited for over 30 min in waiting area and then left. They kept serving other customers that walked in after us and making us wait. Very frustrating…I was in the drive through for 25 minutes and I was only depositing 3 checks to 1 account. The drive through teller was helping someone in the lobby with only 1 station opened outside is what he told me. This was ridiculous and the drive through should of been shut down if they are short staffed. With my previous experiences with this location I believe it is bad management and poor staffing. I’m going to really think about moving my money to another bank.The manager is very inaept and is a smart aleck, the relationship banker is also very lazy and the turnover rate at the teller counter is unreal. The staff is very uncoordinated and give misinformation frequently. The ATM is also always out of order when it isn't stolen. The location on Nacogdoches and Bulverde are much better. I've been with chase about 7 years and this location has always given me problems after they got new staff about 2 years ago.The banker Ian Andujar is excellent, he took care of me and my wife with the highest possible ethics, people like him must double, thank you very much Chase BankAtm is either  not working or now completely removed.  Hopefully they will be replacing the old one with a new or working atm. This is a pretty common issue over the past year with 🏧  being unavailable for use or closed? Need to start thinking about another options for a better more reliable banking solution if this is not fixed soon.3 stars because there is never a working atm. the workers inside r always so fabulous, but there is no convenience at this location. pls fix atm or add 24 hour lobby one :-/Complete inconvenience. They do not have an indoor ATM. I went to activate my debit card, but all they did was assign the pin. They didn’t explain or suggest that I should need to complete my activation with more steps. Complete inconvenience.Excellent customer service but no drive thru ATM.No ATM and they have no idea when they will get another. Wtf….chase bank can’t afford a new ATM?!?!They took the ATM away. This location is officially useless.Still No ATM? Really?","Positives:
- Chris Luna was very helpful and quickly resolved the customer's issue.
- The bank has multiple notaries available without needing an appointment.
- The banker Ian Andujar provided excellent service and had high ethics.
- The staff inside the bank is described as fabulous and providing excellent customer service.

Room for Improvement:
- The bank should work on reducing wait times and coordination between the drive-through and lobby.
- The management and staffing at the branch are criticized for poor management, lazy behavior, and misinformation.
- There are complaints about the ATM not working or being removed, causing inconvenience for customers.

174,Chase Bank,"11640 Bandera Rd, San Antonio, TX 78250",San Antonio,"Brittany was amazing! I came here today to cash a check from someone who banks here and she was wonderful! She explained there may be a 10.00 fee since I don’t bank here, but checked prior and came back with great news…No fee! She was so friendly and I enjoyed my experience with Chase!Good service each time I visit. Cashiers, loan officers, everyone who works at Chase has always been friendly and professional in their dealings.We are a Private Client- I had an issue with my account, the Private Client banker said he would get back to me.  I called left 2 messages for him after I never head from him, no response to my calls.  We have three accounts, looking at other options.  Why have a private banker who doesn’t do anything?Alejandra Cuevas was incredible !! Very nice!! Attentive and just a very sweet lady.  I was skeptical at first about coming to this bank but just because of Alejandra I’ll be coming back !! Thanks !!Chase has been super busy and understaffed as of late with long waits to see a personal banker. Fortunately we were greeted by Brittney, who was excellent at customer service. Not only did she help me schedule an appointment, at another branch that had availability but was able to issue new debit cards for me and set up online banking.

Really appreciate you!I came in today and was not greeted. I sat in the waiting area for 30 minutes and no employees said anything to me. Then a banker named Christina came to ask if I needed help. I told her what I needed and she told me there were 2 bankers working and I would get the next available. A couple comes in and gets in line for the teller. They have a problem and go sit with a banker to resolve it. Then Christina comes and tells me all the bankers are booked for the day. Horrible service. No one even acknowledged I was there for 30 minutes. Not a hello, not can I help you. I just came in to get skipped in line and sit for 45 minutes. I left and immediately went to the branch off Mainland and Bandera and was taken care of in 15 minutes.Worst location I have ever been to! The people in this office sit around and do absolutely nothing and will not even put a sign on their ATM machine that says out of order. They rely on the electronic notice after you spend 2 minutes working the slow machine until a notice pops up to tell you it is out of order. There were four people sitting around doing nothing including a greeter. Why don't you put some of them to work behind a teller line?What a joke!  They only have 1 person to do a notary and even if you called ahead someone gets in front of you that  takes forever!Chase is replacing their employees with atm machines. They have made lots of people lose their jobs.  Go someplace else. I am closing my account and I currently am  at a bank where you have PEOPLE to give you great customer service. I can call and guess what I can speak to a nice person.Do not visit this branch, tellers are clueless and don’t know what they are doing. Zero customer service, and don’t care attitude… Maybe invest more in educating your staff. Thanks chase for crashing my dream, while holding my cashiers check.We’ve had a great experience with our business banking here. Clint, our banker, goes above and beyond in every way possible!I have been trying to contact  them since 9:30 am and its now 2pm have called both carlos and Clint throughout the day and have yet been able to get through or have them call me back .I can't believe I go through this every time I need help from them ..I time to go somewhere else I guessTerrible. Cant get ahold of anyone. I’m getting hung up on constantly.I’ve been here a few times using the drive through banking. Friendly and helpful staff!Employees are terrible abs disrespectful to customersEDDIE RODRIGUEZ IS A VERY RUDE MANAGER","Positives:

175,Chase Bank,"6596 Farm-To-Market Rd 78, San Antonio, TX 78244",San Antonio,"Horrible customer service two of the workers clearly don't want to work came to open an account for my husband and they were finding any excuse not to help us open an account while trying to rush us. Clearly chase doesn't want customers. Went to Bank of America, afterwards on FM78 and we were treated kindly and they helped us open an account in walk in.We went to the thru through window to deposit a check. We accidentally filled out the withdrawal form not the deposit form. The “guy” at the window name is Patrick. He was so rude he said we filled out the wrong form and rolled his eyes. He then took long. We got our receipts but he never said everything was fine or thank you or nothing!!  This was the WORST experience we had. And it was a big deposit to your bank!  Maybe he need a nothing job that fits him.  We will not go to this chase ever again.
This was on 78 & Foster #000697 @2:30pmJeff Burrier, Vice President, of 6596 FM Branch, is truly a Rockstar. I've had the most pleasant experience, this morning. Jeff helped me set up my Chase App. I'm the world's worst, when it comes to technology! He was patient, informative, warm, welcoming & professional, All tied up in a little package. Never lost his patience. Took his time. I just moved back to Texas. Jeff, never made me feel illiterate. He advised me, so I Never have to stand in line again.....Thanks, so much, Jeff, for the Education!!! You really showed me how much you care about your clients.....You truly are a Rockstar......I'm very appreciative,  indeed!!!Worse service ever. I understand you are a busy bank but maybe hire more people. The manager made me go back on the line because I needed to buy a lil bit of change for my side business. I was there for more than 1 and a half hours. Not except able. Very rude.Came to cash there own check, and since I bank at a different bank, and don’t have an account with them. They charge a $10 cashing fee……smh!On march 11, 2022 A young beautiful African-American young woman assisted me. She was wearing glasses and was working around 3 PM in the afternoon.I feel terrible I lost her business
She gave me I believe her name is Jayla I know it starts with a “J” she was wearing glasses and has a beautiful smile and work in the drive-through. So my day wasn’t really going that well but my son surprise me that he got honor roll. So I said let me go to the bank and get out some money for him to surprise him. When I got to the teller I was greeted with up most respect, phenomenal best customer service ever!!
This young lady had the most beautiful smile you can see through this glass window. I feel every customer should experience this and this is how you represent Chase!!! She was so thoughtful I told her that I needed “50 “ ones! She asked me if I didn’t mind was a part of a celebration and I said yes she said I’ll be glad to give you some nice crispy clean ones!
That really made my day that she was interested in making my sons surprise more better and she wrote a little note for him. My son is thriving and he put in (tremendous effort) and that note he will remember forever she was congratulating him. And we are so thankful for the small things in life. Thank you to Chase and staff stay safe and God bless in Jesus name!Had a difficult situation with a check written out to my deceased father from an insurance company. A wonderful young man named Isaac was able to assist me. He was super helpful, patient, and courteous during my ordeal. Nice job. Hope someone that works there recognizes this young man for his great work ethic.Only tellers. Bad service. All three tellers were just talking amongst themselves for 5-10 minutes while a line of people kept growing before they helped anyone out. On top of that, after the wait I find out they’re useless. When asked about notary services: “go across the street to UPS or another branch”. When asked to open a non-standard account: “You need to make an appointment at another branch”. What’s the point of this place? The people here are useless. The ATM is even more helpful because it responds to you immediately instead of making you wait while gossiping.What is up with chases drive tru ATMs? 8 out of 10 times, there is always issues. I can't make deposits nor get withdraws. And it's always another chase bank location that is having similar issues.Stop by to get a simple notary done. Loan officer could not take four minutes to help me out and tells me to go across the street and pay for it at the UPS store. And then proceeded to tell me to come back at 1:30 when they close at 2 o’clock. We all know if I showed up at 1:30 there be some excuse to not get a notary done. Terrible customer service skills. I will be closing my account. I know this will not cause chase any issues , but There are plenty of other banks to go to.Worst service ever. Teller Isaac states Chase bank NEVER gives change.  The Corp I work for has been using them for at least 7 years and I have never heard of a bank not giving change.  When we ask to speak to a supervisor he refuses to call them. Once back at the office we called and asked to speak to a manager and tell them why they hang up. NEVER go to this branch if you want your money to be safe.  Why would you keep change from a deposit then refuse to tell us why unless Isaac or his manager are short in their drawer.I went in to change my name on all of my cards. I was “helped” by Blake. He had all my cards reissued to me within a couple of weeks, with one problem, he didn’t change my name on any of my cards. On top of that they never answer their phones. So weeks later I have to find a different branch to assist me on this. Really bad service. Capitol One lets you do name changes over the phone.Went in to cash a check and possibly set up a savings account. I sat there for an hour ducking and dodging the sales tactics because nobody listened to what I said I wanted and left with no cash because even though the check I was given is from chase, they have to verify the funds are real. Left with things I didn’t need or ask for but was easier to say yes than try and explain what I wanted over and over. I ended up just walking out with who I came with unhappy and unwilling to ever recommend this bank ever again.The service was great for me. They were all booked with appointments to speak with a personal banker. Yet they fit me in and handled everything I needed help with in a timely fashion. Adan was very helpful as well as the tellers. Definitely using this chase again!Outrageous....
Cost 10$ to cash a 25$ check. Anybody takes a check from a Chase Bank you better add $10 to your total. I now rank Chase in the worst possible position tied with Bank of America. Don't bank with ChaseMy wife and I have a joint checking account with chase and we wanted to open a joint savings.   For that we have to visit a branch.  We went in this morning gof to the front of line amd we were told we would have to make an appointment on the app.  So no slots are available for the month of november on Saturday.  That's the only time we can do it.Slowest service ever….
Seriously considering changing banks,
On a side note if you go to a drive thru have your business ready.

179,Bank of America,"5403 De Zavala Rd, San Antonio, TX 78249",San Antonio,"I own a business in San Antonio and was interested in talking to BOA about moving / keeping my business with them, however nobody answers the phone at any location and the voice robot will not transfer anyone to a bank employee. I spent an hour on the phone trying to get through to someone with BOA in San Antonio with no success, even though my business has banked with BOA for +10 years with an active account in very, very good standing. BOA seems to have no interest in attracting business accounts. How in the world do they expect to grow if business owners can't speak to a real person over the telephone and are relegated to talking to a robot?If you want to become a Medicaid/Medicare provider DO NOT open a business account with them. They won't provide you with a bank letter, which is required to complete your enrollment as a provider with Medicare. They do not know what a bank letter is. They do not support small businesses nor support the requirements from CMS (Center for Medicare and Medicaid). They are making it very difficult to service 2 of the most at risk populations in Texas (children and seniors). Already looking for another bank that actually supports smalls businesses and the requirements that federal agencies request from them.The tellers at this bank are the absolute best. It gets really busy sometimes but everyone is efficient, nice and helpful. Beth is my go-to but they’re all great!This is the worst bank location I ever been too the employees are ridiculously rude to everyone including elderly people and the Manager talks to the other tellers in Spanish and talks bad about the customers in Spanish as well they mock elderly people for not knowing how to use their debit cards and the Manager telling the tellers Her personal life they are very arrogant and rude and also were laughing of people cause they didn’t speak English that well and another teller was laughing of a man from India cause of the way that man talked English as well, I’m bilingual and was able to hear all of this while waiting, how horrible and unprofessional this place is I’ve seen the bad reviews almost everyone had posted but it seems no one is doing anything about itWorst customer service here. Planning to make a bank change into chase, I’ve been here 3 times and all these times I have a problem here.Completely agree with Adam's statement. Avoid SAM if possible. The person is always looking for ways to NOT process even basic transactions. Initially I let it slide as people can have off days, yet it has happened each of the past 4-5 times and I have seen him play these games even with a very elderly couple. This person should be ashamed of himself and needs to reflect on his work ethics. Most of the other staff members at the branch are very professional, but as they say, 'one bad fish can spoil the whole pond'.Do not deal with SAM at this branch. This man was playing games about a simple withdrawal I was trying to make from my account. This man tried telling me things that were not even accurate or close to what other reps or other bank locations had done! Complete joke  😂😂😂 no wonder people have rated this place so poorly. Different stories every time.There is more people standing around in business clothes with a tablet in their hands looking busy than there is tellers. Every teller transaction takes 10 minutes or more. It's a terrible location. Drive through is always closed because everyone wants to be tablet standing asking if they can help and then say ""oh okay, the teller with have to help you with that."" 4 tablet standing employees with 1 teller and no drive up window open. Do better....Went here to close my BoA account and they told me that they ran out of checks.  So they gave me a big stack of cash that I had to carry around (unsafe) and deposit elsewhere (a pain to do).  How does a bank run out of checks???  I don't know if they were just trying to make it a pain to close my account, but I won't be doing business with BoA again.I love Bank of America as a bank but this location is the worst! Will never come again to this location!
We had an appointment with a person, got there in the morning and turns out the person was not there and no one was able to help us. Why not call to cancel?
They have no ethics and concerns for other peoples time.I visited the De Zavala Rd branch two weeks ago without an appointment for some emergency paperwork on two of my accounts, and the staff and management were friendly and efficient and completed my requested change quickly. It's not my primary banking location, but I came away wishing it were!Just expect to be on hold forever. Just a nice voice saying ""thank you for calling bank of america please hold"" hold till eternity I think. Do the customer a favor and just don't pick up.
ThanksThis financial institution charges a maintenance fee even though you have direct deposit. The reason is that every deposit has to be at least $250 as opposed to no minimum. That is the most unreasonable policy I’ve hear of. Fixing to go close my account and take my business elsewhere.Very nice and helpful people. So busy but still they are doing their best to make sure the job is done . Thanks a lot for all the hard work . And making customer so comfortable to come back.The worst service ever! The  Service manager Is extremely rude just remember you’re not the owner you’re just an employee like the rest of themGreat experience.  Debit card was taken at ATM and young lady at entrance set my phone up with Google pay in five minutes while still taking care of the customers as they came in.I would like to thank Monica the employee at Bank of America for her kindness and kindness 🙏🏻 She was very kind to me and helped me solve my problem 🤗 Also all the staff at Bank of America are very nice 😇 Thank you Monica 🙏🏻. …excellent attention.

180,Bank of America,"1515 SW Loop 410, San Antonio, TX 78227",San Antonio,"EMILY, the supervisor on shift refused to take my deposit for a business account due to the bills being rolled. When I asked for assistance, she proceeded to tell me I was making a line and to move off to the side.

Her remarks were sarcastic and unwarranted. She didn’t provide any assistance and kept blaming me for the line. The line formed due to them having only two tellers.

Don’t waste your time, the customer service is trash and I know at NFCU…that wouldn’t be the case.

Photo of the line I formed, while EMILY in the black jacket chatting away with someone else instead of assisting me with my deposit.If you have a business and thinking of opening an account with them, save yourself the headache and go to a local bank. Each location I’ve been to has horrible service.It’s ridiculous to see one teller and multiple agents for customers at lobby ,,, cross train people or find a balance on the customers needs . You don’t have a drive thru anymore what’s the problem.I walk into this bank there's a long line and one of the reps ask me how can she help me I responded get more teller's her response that's all we have just 2Worst bank I’ve ever been to in my life. Never go on a Friday. No matter the weather they will force you to stand outside. There’s always just 1, maybe once in a blue moon 2 tellers helping anyone at all times. When the girls walk around with the iPad they pick and choose who they want to talk to no matter how long you’ve been waiting. One girl walked past a handicap man who was waiting longer than me outside and went straight to the man who was last in line outside.Hate this bank like everyone else, ridiculously annoying to try to get someone on the phone. shut my account down with no notice and transferred multiple times just to get disconnected at the end.

I have to say the service received was amazing. I left so happy with not only a new account but an amazing experience.We went to do a write transfer spoke to a representative that he could help us because we didn’t have an appointment. Yet, there was no one waiting in the lobby. He stated that someone had a 10:00 am and had made an appointment online. It was 10:07 am. The appointment was set for 10:00 am and the person had not show up. Went to bring his manager on duty and she too stated that they couldn’t help us. Had they help us, we would have been in and out in 15 minutes. We drove to Southwest Military Branch spoke to representative Vanessa. She ask us if we had an appointment, we said no. She said no worries that she would put on her list and whenever 10 minutes of our arrival she call us into her office and help us with our wire transfer. It took no more then 15 minutes to complete. She offer us excellent customer service and she treat us with respect and she had us feel us very important to her and our branch of Bank of America . We were so disappointed to the visit of Walzem that we concerned pulling out all our money and transfer it to Wellsfargo however because of the excellent service that Vanessa offer at the SW Military branch we decide to keep our money with Bank of America and she offer us her business card and stated that if had any questions and concerns that we should call her personally.Again thank you Vanessa for your help.

When you finally get the the front to the slowest person on earth she can help with basically nothing and her attitude problem is a nightmare.

BANK OF AMERICA AT
CULEBRA AND 1604No spot for negative stars. If they ever get their stuff together,  they would still be mediocre. Business banking is the worst. Terrible service, even more terrible accounting and accountability  .This place is avg. I have trouble with the customer service sometimes but this takes the cake. They are asking people to rob you. This place is dark and they never have the lights on. The WELLSFARGO across the street give me light enough light to watch my back. Please fix this.Don’t bank here my wife does. How ever I’m glad I don’t bank here. Waited in line for 30 minutes.!!!! Some of our nice older people in line had to sit down due to how long we all had to wait in line. We held there place in line. Who ever the manager is here at this BOA location needs some reevaluation done on how to manage and run a successful Bank. Not once did a manager come outside to help out. I’m just happy I don’t bank here nor will I consider banking here based off this experience. Great Job BOA Manager of the 1604 and culebra location.Only branch around here that is open on a Saturday and they weren't able to process my notary due to full schedule. So they sent me across the street to the UPS Store for the notary service and reimbursed the fee for me right away. Super friendly and helpful.Been a customer for over 25 years. Kept calling to see if they had a notary there. There is no way to get in touch with someone at the location. There are just a bunch of redirection to their website.  I get to the location and I am told that while they do have notaries, they cannot help me because I don't have an appt. But I can't make an appt because there is no way to call. Horrible customer serviceThey said to me yesterday they have not had a drive thru teller in 3 years here. Okay so then they have ""one"" lady working as a teller inside yesterday for the whole bank. I like BOA in general but this branch is terrible. The app wasn't working so of course you had to go inside. Don't need a door person sitting around, need more tellers. Come on. I added a photo so you can see I'm not exaggerating.Had an investment appointment scheduled almost a month prior to showing up. Drove an hour from New Braunfels (this was only branch with Saturday appt.) to this location to find out the financial advisor was on vacation. No call from this branch to reschedule the appointment. Wasted 2 hours of my day.Went in five minutes late for my appointment welcomed me with a smile and was very helpful lending manger Michael was wonderful going to this branch was a delight and change from the other branches staff was lovely and I was helped in a timely manner great over all experience.Are y'all really that lazy to not answer your phone calls I literally drove by and saw y'all just talking and standing and only one person and two cars in drive thru and extra employees with nothing to do but laugh what a joke.The only person who really work in this bank is Patty she is amazing but the other are lazy and looks like they does not love the job and you have to wait more than one hour to make movementsCustomer service lacking a general apathy towards their customers I should not be surprised since the reviews here are terrible. You have a problem you should fix it.Thank you BOA.. I dont have an acct. But u made it easy for me to send my tia $ for funeral services.. greatly appreciated..They help me close a safe deposit in another branch.

Very bad customer service and quality.Tellers and lobby personnel are very attentive & helpful. Made an appointment to see the notary, but then had to cancel the appointment. Called the branch number for 15 minutes to cancel the notary and no one ever answered the phone. For this reason I rate this bank branch a three!Very bad experience given my first time visiting there. We went to visit to add me to one of their members accounts. We had an appt at 10:30 and showed up right at 11:15, which we tried to call ahead of time and let them know that our meeting before theirs was running late. They never called us back or ever answered the phone. Then when we arrived, Mary Lou rolled her eyes as we walked in and immediately told us they were booked for any appointments. Didn’t ask us if why were there or showed any kind of indication that they wanted to give us good customer service. I’ve work in customer service for over 15 years and have received several awards, this was unacceptable.I have been a customer for over 25 years, I went to make a deposit, and the atm machine did not give me a receipt.  I went inside and spoke to a manager and said not to worry and check my account the following day. The following nothing showed posted and was given a number to make a claim. First person who took my information to make a claim never submitted my information correctly, I was told by another agent, yesterday I received a letter stating that my claim was resolved and that my money was not found on the day they audited the atm machine. I asked for supporting documents and videos and a more detailed explanation with facts on how they came with that decision. Of course, their answer for video footage they need a subpoena. I have never felt so frustrated 😠 Somebody has $2380 extra in their pockets.

***update
I filed a complaint with the OCC office of the comptroller of the currency. The OCC got in contact with the bank. Within a week, I had a resolution specialist from the bank calling me. In less than 1 month, my issue was resolved . My money was found, and I believe no one had actually inspected the atm machine properly.Ms. Taylor was excellent!! She’s the type to go out of her way for the customers, and I appreciate that. I got here 5 minutes before closing, and she assisted me with an amazing treatment. Wonderful person.I wish I could give 0 stars. I have been trying to get ahold of someone on the phone for the last 2 hours and no one will pick up. What a joke of a bank. I am sure glad that I am switching from this bank.

UPDATE: I was on the phone trying to get ahold of someone for over 5 hours and still did not reach anyone. What a joke. I would advise others if you need something to go into a branch and not call because their phones must not be working or the employees just don't want to answer the phone.This branch accused me of a faulty check because of my skin color and not being a member. Tried to blame me of my age, had to cash a check for my grandfather (his bank). They must feel stupid when they called him to confirm I was indeed not committing a  fraudulent check. Idiots.

Other branches are fine, not this one.It's mid.  Nothing special, kinda old layout, sometime empty others overwhelmed.  The atms are okay.  They are a bit slow and their very picky with cash deposits spitting out the money it can't read. Kinda crazy.Horrible custmer service. I waited an hour and half to meet with a rep which I was fine with because I didnt have an appointment but the way I was talked to was pretty unprofessional seeing how many issues I have had with my account. Im glad I made the decison to leave Merril Lynch and Bank of American.The bankers and customer service representatives are notch professionals. Very professional and attentive to myself and staff every time I visit.Very slow with little to no consideration of people time! I hate this bank only 1 teller open with a line wrapped around  the corner it’s no excuse people should have to wait so longGreat service. Wonderful Manager. Great ancillary services (Safe Deposit Box)All ATMs are currently out of service. This is the second time a similar event like this has happened at this location.Customer service is beyond HORRIBLE.  I should have read the other posts before coming as it seems to be a major trend!Excellent customer service today. The rep at the door went above and beyond in suggesting solutions that would help me avoid the line.Bad customer service, rude and attitudeMrs Lory is one of the most professional consultant that we have ever met , thank you again for your best cooperationThere is no internet here and I came 2 time and No one was the to help me and I had to be there and there was no oneGreat service.Slowest tellers ever!!Excellent service","Positives:

185,Bank of America,"7333 Wurzbach Rd, San Antonio, TX 78229",San Antonio,"I represent a business for deposit. This location is by far th rudest in the system.

They mad a claim hat I was rude and cussed at them when in fact all i said was I hate this bank.

I will no longer go here and will make my deposits at the Vance Jackson location.

If i could give ZERO stars i would. The night drop is CONSTANTLY broken so you can no even avoid the interaction with these rude peopleCalled many location several times today not a single person can answer the phone. I see a bunch of comments talking about great customer service none of them can even answer the phone. What are you talk about? horrible service...Bank of America is by far the worst bank to do business with! They systems are slow, outdated, and designed to keep you stuck with their subpar service! I am cutting all ties with Bank of America!This ATM location/machine does not disperse hundred dollar bills, highest denomination are $20's.Every single time I come in this place I encounter issues with the foreign invasion. There will be a number of middle easterners with no interpreter attempting to make transactions. What alarms me the most, is that there are no personnel at the facility that may assist them quicker. If they would have an individual who was fluent in Arabic, the financial institution wouldn't have such a circus  appearance.I went to get a notary here. The staff was trying to find every reasons to avoid from getting notary.
The moment I said word “notary” she immediately told “sorry we are not doing any notary today as we dont have appointments”. I told her that I have appointments. She smiled and asked about appointment details. Also she mentioned the person doing notary may not be available due to some emergency in their home. But the notary person was available in bank only.

Finally after seeing my document she said sorry they can’t notary my document due to bank policy. I explained her that need not to notary on same document instead attach a acknowledgement form and seal it. She said sorry we can’t do it. I explained her again that another bank of america location did this way and shown her my previous notarized document. Finally she agreed that she will check and confirm. After 15 mins of research and printed acknowledgment form and advised us that she will check with notary person.

The end result was they can’t notary my document and explained why. I respect their decisions.

My point is they are trying to find every reasons to avoid notary services. I felt they are treating us this way because its a free service provided by BoFA. I believe If its paid service they may treat us in a better way.I made an appointment to make some changes to my account. Got there early and the rep who was going to help me was assisting someone else so another rep jumped in to work with me. He was super quick, efficient, and very friendly. This is my second time here and both occasions have been great!It is 9:43am on a Friday at time I am writing this. There are 10 people waiting in line with only ONE TELLER open.
Shoutout to Esther for being the only one working! She is Amazing!
Update 4:18PM
NO I CANNOT USE THE ATM!
I was in need of change in coins. Tell me how can I get that at an ATM?
I will wait...1 teller as always, doesn’t make sense to me. So much for customer service! There was a line wrapping around in the lobby and they had one teller with a co-worker standing behind her.
UNBELIEVABLE HORRIBLE SERVICE!!! I hate BOA. Not to mention they don’t have a drive thru either.  Before BOA responds to this asking me to use the ATM, please know that this is a business account and need two verifications of the deposit that was made.Avoid this location unless you have no other choice. The waits are absurd, it would be faster to go to a further location than try to wait. Drive-thru hasn't been available so that means long waits standing in line. Not worth it, makes me want to switch banks out of the inconvenience.This is the location that I started my banking 8 years ago and I can not take the management that work here any longer. Terrible service and zero knowledge. They should train their people better. Now I'm really considering taking my business somewhere else and cancel all my five accountsI had such a great experience with one of the tellers Stacey & one of the financial mangers helga! Such an amazing team just signed up with Bank Of America today! They are awesomeThis BoA location has only ONE teller during a Saturday morning… the audacity. 15 people in line. When asked questions, most staff respond in a frustrated/condescending manner. This building should be torn down 🤦🏻‍♂️… …Over 10 people in line and 2 tellers and most frustrating of all NO business line very annoying. What BOA doesn't have a business lineI love the ATM U CAN PRINT 1K @Z SAM TIMEWorst service ever biggest lobby in San Antonio and only 1 teller that is not good customer servicePoorly staffed. Wait times for counter service are beyond unacceptable.Who the he'll is managing this f.cken bank always 9 of us in line and 1 f.cken teller... USLESSNot at all happy with this locations customer service!Terrible having to wait with over 10 people in line & only 2 tellers insideI went twice to this location asking for help with urgent matter and I am not going back.The service is getting worse and worse.Does not answer the phone.Fast","Positives:

186,Bank of America,"5201 Broadway, San Antonio, TX 78209",San Antonio,"Every business would be fortunate to have Jennifer Morin represent their organization!!  She is incredibly knowledgeable, thorough, respectful, thoughtful, and caring, and takes tremendous pride in her work!!  She and her coworker Desiree Bermudez Hernandez, who has the same work ethic as Jennifer, took fantastic care of me in opening a new business account, and they assisted me with several other things!  Every time I see Jennifer and Desiree at the bank, they always greet me with a smile and treat me like I am their only customer!!  Bank of America - Alamo Heights is truly blessed to have these two young ladies represent them!  If BofA Alamo Heights is not your local branch, I encourage you to make it yours so you can be treated as well as I am!  Thank you again for everything, Jennifer and Desiree!!I came in on a Tuesday, and stood in line for almost 45 minutes. There were only 2 people ahead of me when I got in line.  They only had 1 teller, but there were other bank employees walking around. Not one single one even asked if I had been helped, or any of the 9 people behind me. I finally walked up to someone and asked if they could please have another person open up a window so we could all get on with our day. They said they did have another person, but no one came out.

Very disappointing and will not be coming back to this branch again.Atrocious customer service. Absolutely incredibly incompetent. I was with Bank of America 35 years. They were once a fine bank. They are hideously understaffed, and simply do not care if you like it or not. I went to Frost and never looked back. They actually take care of customers, unlike BoA.Raquel is the best teller, but there is always only one. I always spend more than 30 minutes just waiting in line compared to other banks in which it just take me less that 10 minutes. Bank of America should hire more tellers. There is always somebody at the front door wanting us to use the atm, y'all forgetting something important: service.Typically, long waits!
Woefully understaffed.  Many customers, after waiting in line over 20 minutes, gave up in frustration  and left the bank.
No one available to receive customers + answer their questions.Too long wait times. Lobby hours not long enough.Slow ,never got help .employees just talking and laughingThe manager should not be a manager as she was so rude.the drive up atm always seems to be not working ( the touch screen unresponsive)
what’s the point of advertising as a bank with an atm if it never worksOne teller and a line literally out the door , feels like everytime I go here it is like thisThis Location its very bad service and  the manager rule dont waist your time here.No one answers the phone.Poor service","Positives:

All he said was ohh call customer service and they will help you I can only do so much on my end .My husband had explained my account .I went today 9/30/23 to this location on millatary  ladies in the front where so helpful , even tho I was already angry and frustrated cause of all week dealing with login and making calls to customers service them unlocking and sending temporary passwords and updating my info cause stupid bank man didn’t update my shyt in person when I went with him. So I went in person to millatary this lady I think her name was marthe pos her she went up and beyond she called customer service. She got code.  She also made sure all my stuff was updated correctly on her computer she even had me look over it made sure everything looked correctly put and spelled , she even waiting for me to login she wasn’t in a rush nothing what so ever she even had me log out and log back in to make sure online app was working and I was able to login again thank you so much for helping me out I even explained thank god cause I was about to just come and close account and get my money back .. AS FOR THIS MAN RILEY OUT ON INSTAGRAM IF YOU DONT LIKE YOUR JOB LOOK FOR SOMETHING ELS CAUSE I LOOKED AT THERE REVIEWS AND THEY NOT LOOKING GOOD INGRAM NEEDS NEW EMPLOYEES!!! And that raciest shyt you pulled on my husband, I didn’t appreciate that !!! Somone needs to check him!! -Manager or corporate-!!!!So disappointing! I visited this site last Saturday to ask what I need to open a checking account for my daughter (a minor). I didn’t get an accurate info and today I was turned down by a very serious lady who did not greet us, not one single smile, not any sign of wanting to help us, and she asked me if my daughter and I had the same nationality!! That’s when I understood that she was being racist because she told her coworker what was going on and that I only speak Spanish.
Well, I’m bilingual and I already have 2 checking accounts at this bank, which I might close soon.Awesome customer service! All tellers and employees super sweet! Ana was Aaamazing and so patient w my new account sign up!💕 Thank you all so much. & God bless you!💕 …They would not cash a check issued by their bank. The lady claimed because I did not have an account I could not cash it there. I know that’s a lie because I’ve already cashed a check with no issues. She reacted really weird and instead of giving me a more in depth reason to why it could not be cashed, she walked away from the teller window in a hurry. I’m glad I don’t bank here you just hear nothing but problems with Bank of America. I believe it’s a real issue when they refuse to pay out money issued by their own bank.We came in today to update an address, and enroll into online banking. We were greeted and the rep was very nice. Then Michelle R. helped us. Very knowledgeable, professional, gave tips on what not to do when it came to using Zelle. Gave you a sense of peace and she genuinely wanted to assist. She is great and deserve a promotion or an increase in her pay. Congratulations BOA on having great employees. The manger came in a few times to give Miss Michelle over rides and she was so very courteous and professional. Also no long wait time time. Thank you again!I'll give y'all 5 stars
Loyal customer since 2015!
I 💕 my BANK!!!! …I love this location. The staff is so nice and courteous. They check on you while you wait in line.  I would like to see more tellers on busy times but I understand the lack of staff. I have banked here for many years. Thinking of even applying for a job.I recently went into the lobby and it was disappointing.  Now I used to work at this location about 9 years ago and WOW has it gone downhill. Only 2 tellers? We are talking about Bank of America and only 2 tellers. The line was long and the atmosphere felt cold due to the eye contact given without saying hello from the employees. Wow and no drive thru lol come on BofA. I used to work with more than 10 employees at that location. If I could give no stars then I would. I am sooo glad I left this bank and found a bank that allows me to be a REAL relationship banker.There was no waiting in line at Bank Of America... It was fast and easy... and there was security officer walking around for our safety... Thanks Bank Of America and San Antonio Texas of military drive...Its a Friday. There were 15 people in line and only one window open. 6 employees standing around in the lobby.Nice bankHorrible location unprofessional. Low staff.

Nombre and then again my husband asked him a question he made a face and said idk what he’s asking I don’t know Spanish . I told him what my husband asked he said Noo just call customer service and they will help you. I was all week calling trying to figure out how to open dam account I’ve had this account in the past and never had problems with it. Customer service said we updated you gmail , you account is locked , we unlocked it, they gave me temporary passwords like 4”3/4 times over the week.

I called back about 10 times at various times because I could not drive to the location. No one ever answered the phone. Why provide a business phone number if no one is ever going to answer the phone? I still do not know what Carlos wanted to tell me:/Racists!! I had a tax refund that was made to our name. The woman teller gave us a discriminating look because of our arabic names and especially my mom cause she was wearing her scarf. She didn't want to serve us cause of a space on the check between the name. So we asked for a supervisor and he came to us laughing and had no intention of helping. Such disgusting and rude employees as well as discriminating. So we went to a different bank of America and that bank of America helped with no problems at all and were really professional. Greeted us as soon as we walked in and were helped within 10 minutes.So u ask questions they treat you like if you were not as good as them , they misinform you , make u feel unwanted , like if it bothers them to assist u , why go to work if u lay your personal frustrations on the customers , I don't bank with bank of america my payroll was deposited at the bank they opened an account for me after I closed it I'm stuck with a bank card an account that I don't want nor need I have 1400 sitting in this bank and it is Goin in a month and they won't release to me , something is wrong here its my money and u alls processing is never accurate everybody has a different version , I will never bank with bank of america I want my money ur nightmare will end once I get it , oh yeah train your people more to have morals and treat people better what's happening now its not right !!!!! My rating is 0 but u forced a 1 on me , TRAIN YOUR EMPLOYEES !!!I would like to thank Elda for the service she provided on April 16th.  I needed to have two accounts modified. Elda took her time and walked me through the entire process. She was very professional and super friendly.  Elda’s attention to detail was fantastic.  Thanks again for the fine service.What a horrible service and experience… After waiting in line with my 11 month old baby and being pregnant. The teller didn’t even waste her time to help me proceed with my transaction, gave the wrong information about the bank services, and made me leave to another Bank of America branch where they proceed with no issue my transaction being better dedicated and pleasant. Also try to call them later to understand or make a complaint, just waited and waited on the phone and simply like that the machine hung up on me. Such a disappointment!The worst bank .
Two times they lost my debit card when I ask him respond we don’t know. I gonna to close my accountWorst bank ever, this company is so out dated nobody is on the same page they constantly give you the wrong information. Keep vaild checks on hold for weeks….i should have known something was up when you were forced to go into the branch for anything instead of the drive thru banking (TRASH) this whole company needs a revamp on customer service. Proper training is needed in all departments, i see why america has ranked this bank the worst, i was better off at chase.Some rude lady denied help before she seen/heard my entire issue. It would make sense to actually look at someone's account before you deny them. Not everyone is a fraud/thief. Some people are honest citizens that have different circumstances. Just because someone is black doesn't with a ""third-party"" check does not mean they are up to something. Training needs to be done especially coming from another manager. It's sickening and ridiculous.Very Good service and customer care . They took care of my accounts and queries very well. staff is well mannered and helpful.They are really kind, friendly, fun, understanding and respectful !I met with Elda and she gave me a whole new experience about the bank. She was patient and kind. She answered my questions professionally too.One star is one star too many. Can not get them to pick up the phone. I tried for about 10 minutes earlier today.

189,Bank of America,"2903 Thousand Oaks Dr, San Antonio, TX 78247",San Antonio,"If I could give no stars, I would. First, let me say, I do not hold a Bank of America acct. I received a paper payroll check that was drawn on BOA. I opted to cash it here. The teller tells me that the font on the check seemed suspect and handed off to the manager. Not only is the manager EXCEPTIONALLY rude, she refused to verify that my check was legit and stated “policy” was not to cash it at all. I drove to a BOA five miles up the road and cashed the same check with no issues. I returned to this location to get her supervisor’s information, and again, I was met with more attitude and poor customer service. How many  bad reviews before y’all get rid of this lady? I don’t care if I am a large black man in a backwards hat. That’s not how you conduct business and treat your customers!I went to this branch because it was the most convenient to me at the time. I've gone back several times to meet with the same banker, Maria Fernanda, and I have been happy every time. She is knowledgeable, helpful, and made me feel comfortable and confident in choosing BoA to do business with. Every employee at this location has always been courteous and pleasant, acknowledging customers as they walk in, and giving guidance to folks that needed help.First time at this location.

Sandra Villanueva, the literal vice president-financial center manager, didn't take the time to understand what I was asking for (A simple bank letter with my account information and signed by a bank representative), had me sit and wait for her to process the line, and then proceeded to tell me that she was not actually allowed to sign any documents.

I recommend going over to the Nacogdoches location, where they are super friendly, informative, and actually want to help you.

I will not be coming to this location again, especially since I pay for their services.

(Dominique, was super nice and polite, though.)

EDIT: I called another BOFA and found out that each location has its own bank stamp, so while it is against their policy to sign things (even if it's accurate) I still went back to get the stamp from Sandra. Gotta help yourself out in these streets!Worst bank ever! Do not ever use this branch or honestly BOA. Maria Fernanda Rodriguez was abrasive and filled out our notary documents improperly. There was a misunderstanding over witness instructions, and she ended up signing both the notary and witness, rendering our document useless on Friday, April 21

When we tried again today, we were informed that no one could serve as the witness for our documents and that we should have brought our own. As a new couple to San Antonio, we don't have many contacts that we could bring along. As a prior notary in Florida and someone who spent a decade working in law firms, I was very taken aback that you don't allow your staff to act as witnesses. This should have been something in BOLD when making the appointment online, as most legal documents require a witness.

Overall, Maria was impolite, unfriendly, and uncommunicative. She refused to help offer a solution and told us, “this is a free service,"" and we didn't have to get our documents notarized with her. I hope this isn't how BoA trains its employees to handle a misunderstanding.I dropped them after 2 weeks. By far the worst bank ever!! To bad you have to give them a star to post a reviewStaff was very helpful but there were far too few of them for the amount of customers. The customers were incredibly b&;$chy and the staff handled them with class.Horrible, Not friendly at all. Charged $8 dollars to cash a check. Zero common sense. No one could explain to me why they charge $8 dollars to cash a check other than I don't have an account. So, the person that write the check does. But if I cash it at RBFCU no fee. I asked how does that make sense when Im coming directly to the bank that the check is written from. Im cutting out the middle man which means less work less liability why charge me a fee. Charging $8 dollars to cash a check from an account at the bank the were the check is written from makes no sense to me. I remember why I changed to RBFCU long ago.  I would never bank where if I write a check out of my account the bank then turns around and would charge my friends, my family, my employee's a fee to cash my check....taking my money away from them. Horrible horrible horrible never bank at Bank of America if you write a check to someone just know Bank of America will not honor the full amount you wrote the check for.No wonder why google rating of this location is so low. Manager Sandra is rude and make customer life difficult even if she doesn’t have to. If I could I gave zero.Always out of notary at this particular location or they will tell you they are booked for all day so come later! Very inconvenientI needed to withdraw cash from my account. For whatever reason, their card reader couldn't  get a swipe from my card, the lady didn't have any other options apparently and suggested I call customer support to raise my ATM withdrawal limit. Customer support said they couldn't do that, but that they saw no reason why my card wouldn't work. They suggested I ask the manager to help an maybe try a different device. The manager must have sized me up and decided I wasn't worth the effort because she said they didn't have any other options. I don't know if this was a race thing because I have brown skin, or because I am wearing shorts, but I'm leaving here feeling discarded and disregarded while unable to access my account which does have than sufficient funds. This place was awful towards me.Pretty ridiculous to be a bank and not have any tellers working in the branch. Yet there are still three or four other employees there in the branch working just no one who’s able to cash checks or process any transactions makes no sense. Why even have this branch open. Fire the three useless employees and hire a teller!!!Only one person is handling cash at a time. Go early to avoid a line.Worst customer service in San Antonio. All those people in there are Mad of the world.Poor attention from the executives María Rodríguez and the lady in the reception area.My mom went to get help with her business account and the lady was extremely rude and seemed to not want to help her at all. The rest of the workers were no help either seems like they don't wanna work. Terrible service. We will be closing our accounts and  going somewhere else.Today, I went to the ATM machine at their door to deposit money, but my money was swallowed by the ATM machine, the money did not reach my account, my English is not very good, I called the number on the ATM machine, but I don't know how to operate  , and then, a lady who worked in their bank, she was very nice, she helped me very enthusiastically, I really appreciate her, but I didn't see her when I left, I didn't say thank you to her face to face, if  You can see, I just want to say thank you very much, you are my angel!  !  !  !  !  !
Also, this five stars is for the lady, if it's for the ATM, I'd choose zero starsWorst bank ever. They are so rude. The woman I spoke to on the phone was literally speaking over me and HUNG UP ON ME. Take your money to a bank that has better customer service. These people are a joke. I’ve been banking with them for 12 years and they STILL can’t treat a long time customer right. What an embarrassment BOA has become.Worst remodel bank ever I know they are trying to push costumers to use the atm but all they’re doing is pushing costumers to go to another bank for real costumer service.Doors locked despite the sign that says their ""new"" hours are 9am-4pm. I called them several times throughout the day and nobody ever answers.Do not come to this location , they always seem they don’t know what they are doing ! always long lines and one person is working","Positives:

Pls do better on yalls work hoursI walked into the lobby and up to a teller station to make a cash deposit. An armed armor truck courier walked in behind me and an employee met him and led him to an inner room. Cora walked up to her teller station, welcomed me with a smile, and asked how she could assist me. Several seconds later, my business completed I let Cora know I would give her a five-star review for her lively service.I haven't had a single positive interaction here.

This branch has been incessantly annoying for the last few years.
They randomly call you ""Just to chat"" from their customer outreach center. When you tell them you're not interested in being upsold or anything, they still try to give you a long-winded sales pitch. I've made it clear that I don't want to receive these calls and yet I still get them multiple times a year.

Pretty much every time I've gone inside for something I've had a long wait.

We scheduled a currency exchange pickup with them. I showed up for what I thought would be a 10 or 15 minute max stop. They told me to take a seat while they pulled out the exchange. Then they were annoyed and rude when I dared to speak up around the 45 minute mark asking what the holdup was. They apparently couldn't open the vault due to staff scheduling conflicts and had to call a manager to handle it. Even though they knew at least one person would be there that day with something that needed
I wasn't even there at start of business or anything when they should have found out about the issue and gotten it resolved, I was there in the afternoon. It still took about an hour altogether for them to open the vault.

I'm honestly considering moving banks altogether now.Sam was great, made sure the process went quick and smooth. Rest of the staff was friendly as well.B of A has always been amazzzzing, which is why I still use it, after ALL of these years. This is the only branch I have ever been to that is truly atrocious. The staff is VERY rude and are fairly incompetent. I have never had an experience, where I don’t feel the staff is confrontational… and I live in NYC! They also seem absolutely uninterested in doing their jobs.Even when given specific instructions (i.e., the ACCOUNT NUMBER) the stupid teller STILL managed to totally screw up a simple deposit transaction (put the money into the wrong account). Worse than worthless.Front desk service attitude is very badAppreciate this location and their serviceIs this location open now?","Positives:
- Friendly and helpful teller named Cora
- Quick and smooth service from employee named Sam
- Overall friendliness of the staff, except for the specific branch mentioned

Room for improvement:
- Inconvenient work hours, especially for customers who work late or on weekends
- Long wait times and slow service inside the branch
- Persistent and unwanted customer outreach calls for upselling

If they are defective them replace them with new ones so that us customers aren't so inconvenienced. Just awful!! If you want a smooth trip to the bank I suggest you go somewhere elseThe Old lady with glasses at this bank is AWFUL!!! She tried to accuse me of stealing money from my family when they took money from the wrong account! When i give them a credit card or debit card they should only be taking money from the account linked to THAT SPECIFIC CARD. Not from some random account under my name other than the one linked to the card given.Thanks to Lenny and all of the tremendously helpful staff, i will be doing all of my future business here with the vance jackson BofA. They helped me open my small business account and set me up with everything i need to get my show on the road to success!I waited over an hour only for them to tell me I need to call their 1-800 number. The level of incompetence at this location is salient from just walking in the door and speaking to them for less than 1 minute. Don’t go here. Don’t bank here. Go over to Chase. They know what they are doing.

Old people and disabled people do not have access to this bank due to its hours. Its inappropriate for this bank to open so late and close so early...? People in this area need access to their financial centers AT REASONABLE TIMES. The people inside at 8:30 am were just standing around inside laughing and chilling. While elderly people waited outside, these people take the bus... that runs on the half hour.

The drive-through is always closed. They open late. Just horrible service, horrible availability of their drive-through services. Just badly managed.

Every time I come here, I end up having to go to the De Zavala branch, because the De Zavala branch actually knows how to operate a bank.If you’re hispanic, don’t come here because you will be met with racist comments. Stacey at the front desk had the audacity to ask us if we spoke english in a condescending tone, even though we started the conversation in English. Super rude and off putting— honestly disgusted with Bank of America.One of the worst banks to bank with. I lost my cards and they couldn’t even help me. Just gave me a phone number to call. I don’t want to spend a long time on the phone waiting for my turn to be assisted. The app asks me to put in the security code I don’t have memorized. They are useless. They’re Customer service is also terrible.This BoA is awful. They never answer the phone, they state they have drive up services, which they DO NOT. They have two ATM's and a drive up window designated for business with a giant closed sign. They removed the all drive thru machines and employee's now use these areas for parking. Management at this location should be evaluated.The worst BofA I have been to, for over 6 years. Management runs this location very poorly. It takes an act of God to get something done. If you are looking to do drive up service with the bank it's not available, they have the employees block drive through lanes also. Don't waste your time 👎👎👎 …Yes I too have the consistent displeasure of having to deal with both bank manager Martha and Abraham rudeness. I mean at what point is it unprofessional? In their minds the tardiness, the lack of respect when addressing you. It's to no end and a perfect mirror of what Bank of America is: RUDE.0 start for services If I could.

‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️

Monday July 24, 2023 I came in and attempted to cash a 5,000 USD check. I was unable to cash the check due to the business bank account guidelines..
No problem.. I cash the check elsewhere and immediately come back to the BOA stand alone ATM directly across from the bank (San Pedro — Bitters & 281)..

I insert * 4,200 * USD into the machine which immediately displays the note “we are unable to return your cash. please confirm how much you’ve deposited” I type in 4,200 and the machines prints a receipt saying “sorry for the inconvenience you’ve encountered, please reach out to tech support” and only deposits * 300 * USD TOTAL..
As you can imagine, I’m beyond upset..

I call the bank manager at
12500 San Pedro Ave
Unit 101
San Antonio, TX  78216
United States
(Located directly across the street) to which she replies that they are unable to help due to the stand alone machine not being a part of their business..
I call technical support and file a claim, only to find out:
It will take anywhere from 10-45 business days to resolve the matter unless the bank finds reason to escalate the situation in which that case it will take 2-3 business days to review..
I have an exclusive client in town since Monday.. this is beyond unacceptable. Not only are a large portion of my funds missing, the wait time is absolutely outrageous. This is my business bank account and I have important business to take care of on a day to day basis.

I am more than unhappy with my experience banking at BOA.
Today is Wednesday July 26, 2023 and I still haven’t received my deposit. I hope to have this issue resolved tomorrow. Once my funds have been returned, I plan to immediately shut down that account.

Even though you are there now and no one else is is being helped .  They must be extremely short staffed. The manager at the front must think I can’t speak Spanish either because I just heard a Spanish speaking patron come in and be helped before me even though she told me it would be an hour wait to help me with an issue on my account.

199,Bank of America,"3000 Pat Booker Rd, Universal City, TX 78148",San Antonio,"My husband and I are veterans. We came to this branch with a pretty big cashiers check drawn off an account at one of their branches. We asked before depositing when the funds were going to be available and told midnight. We were held at the location over 4 hours obviously we were discriminated against by age and race and most likely because we didn't dress as we were wealthy enough for them. After being told they were trying to verify the funds they had us deposit with the teller. Later that evening we received a first email saying they were going to hold the funds an additional amount of time because they suspected they were going to be returned and then a second email stating they would be held even longer. I notified my attorney who issued the cashier check and he tried to cancel the check but was told he would have to wait 90 days before he would be able to cancel the cashiers check. If you need to open an account or do any business in banking this bank is unethical and they are dishonest. I would suggest that you use another bank.ALWAYS 1 teller… but 8-10 in their cubicles doing “busy” work. Hire more tellers,,, and open up your drive thru. Customers are waiting 10-20 min in your lobby just to make deposits…People are USUALLY nice. At least all the women are. But you guy’s serious need to rework your scheduling. When it’s busy you only have One teller and when you aren’t busy you have 3. It’s ridiculous to take over 30mins just to wait for help and then an additional 20 mins to make 3 deposits and get some change. Going through the atm or deposit box isn’t any quicker unfortunatelyAwful, slow, inconvenient times, can't do anything in person without spending 2 hours there. They give you no love ever and that isn't banking.You only need an appointment for financial services, assistance, planning. Otherwise, tellers are always available. Welcoming, professional, friendly and knowledgeable!My mother and i went in the bank with documents a few days after my father passed away to settle his accounts we were told not to worry about anything because the manager would help us.  It turner out 2 months later she did nothing with them!! She had all the paperwork and never uploaded any of it. Thank God that other someone else noticed several weeks later. It's a shame that there's been such poor service for her an elderly widowed lady. Lower your expectations when banking here. I guess.  Lesson learned.Don’t waste your time here, they will just make you feel like a bother if you don’t have an appointment. Just unprofessional to say the leastExtremely poor customer service.
Called and asked if an appointment was needed to change signers on the account, and was told no appointment was needed.   Arrived at the branch to get the signer changed and was told no one would be able to assist us because of shortage of staff and only those with appointments would be seen.  I then asked, if I was a customer who wanted to open an account if I would be turned away and was told, no a banker would assist and would be worked in🤔Manager and staff were very friendly.

Then act clueless when you ask why or if you take time putting said items away. RIDICULOUS) The big guy who's speaks Spanish dont know the name but ill get it next time I go in hes got terrible customer service. The only one who gives my company a hard time when depositing money.What type of bank closes it's doors before the posted closing time? It's bad enough that BOA holds local business checks for days on end, including cashiers checks & State checks, without giving you a penny of interest, but to reach the door, 6 minutes before closing time to find the doors locked, well let's just say it's time to find another bank.New member to this bank and location. Went in this afternoon to make a deposit and was highly disappointed by the customer service I received. The teller by the name of BRENDA was very rude! I said hello good afternoon, and she said absolutely nothing, didn't even make eye contact with me. Told her i needed to make deposit, and she told me to insert debit card. Never said hello or anything, even after I made a comment that I said hello! You would think a woman of her age would have more manners! If you don't enjoy your job, you should not be working with the public. Absolutely unbelievable.Awful customer service. Don’t use this location. Won’t be back. How rude! Shoved out the door and told to call because they can’t help and didn’t have an appointment for a simple question.Stood in line 40 minutes. There was only 1 teller named yadasha. When I got up to her she was counting my bills and slamming them on the desk like a 2 year old with play doh. I asked for quarters and was refused because this was a business line and I don't have a business.
While in line, manager told us another person would be out shortly to help. When I left a hour later, there was still no help.Terrible service. There is four bankers and just one teller helping people. The rest just sitting in front of their computers or talking to each other. 30 min wait and left to another bank that helped me within 5mins.Before Covid, or after Covid, this place never have enough staffs.   Even the manager wasn't helpful.   We paid to have our bank statements print out and he even did wrong on the months requested.   Luckily we check before leaving,  otherwise, we would wasted more timePEDRO IS SO HELPFUL! I had an uncommon account type that I needed to have set up this week. It took 3 days, 3 branches in 2 states and 5 associates to get it done. Pedro got all of the paper work figured out after 3 other people had tried and couldn't figure it out. He really went out of his way this morning to make sure that my account got set up today. I truly appreciate the help given from all of the people that it took to get this done. Thank You again!I setup an appointment on a Monday to open a Business account. Walked into the offices but was not informed about 2 different forms of I.D. DL i had but forgot/unaware to bring my SSN. Took this info as my fault and rescheduled my appointment to the next day/Tuesday. Went back and brough ALL my documentation (DBA, EIN, DL, and SSN). THIS time i was told that the method this BoA branch uses to validate SSN was invalid. Something about using a UV Black light to verify the US seal. I have never had a problem with my Card at any establishment. I was instructed to create my Account online, to which I inquired what the difference would be. The manager, Mr.Pedro, said there was no difference.. I asked him to create an appointment with a different location since it seemed that HIS branch wanted to forgo the work in creating an account for me.

I gave this location 2 stars and not 1 simple due to the fact that they addressed me politely.

EDIT: I was able to create my business account with the other BoA Branch. No additional assistance is needed from the Nacogdoches offices..The worst bank ever. Waited 1 hr to deposit. Manager just sit in the office don’t come out to help while 12 people waiting in line and only one teller.The drive thru is closed but Lobby is open a 9:00 am M-F, ATM opened 24/7. The teller was friendly and fast.Went in to cash a check and the lady wouldn't even take my temporary id she said we don't do that it has to be the actual card if I could give this place a zero star I wouldNo wonder why they have only 2 starts. Worse customer service! The old lady working does one task every hour I guess. Hire people! The manager doesn’t even know what she’s doingSeriously, the worst branch of the most difficult bank to work with. The staff is so rude that it is surprising. Go next door to Randolph Brooks.Scamming bank","Positives:

- Long wait times, with only one teller serving customers.
- Inconsistent customer service, with rude and unhelpful employees.
- Lack of staff, resulting in inefficiency and delays.
- Issues with verifying identification and creating accounts.

Miscellaneous:
- The bank closed its doors before the posted closing time.
- Some employees did not handle transactions properly, causing inconvenience to customers.
- The manager made mistakes in printing out bank statements.
- One customer had a positive experience setting up a unique account type with Pedro's assistance.
- Another branch of the bank was recommended for better service.
- One customer felt the bank was a scam.

202,Frost Bank,"2950 N Harwood St Suite 100, Dallas, TX 75201",Dallas,"I received a call today from Priya asking if I was happy with my Service since my account was fairly new.  I told Priya I was not because I was using my ATM card at a CVS ATM and was still being charged a fee even though the ATM is in your network.  I asked that an audit be done on my account and that I be credited for the fees that were not valid.  I was advised to call Customer Service.  I told her that this is something she should be able to assist with.  She said sorry for the inconvenience and that was the end of the call.  I opened the account because I wanted the service from a local bank but as you can see did not receive that at all.  I will be taking my business elsewhere.My experience with Frost Bank got off to a an excellent start. Pria thank you for all your help!

Frost give this women a raise!I went into open an account and was told we don’t open accounts here. Maybe they could open one up for you at a different bank over in Park cities 5 miles away.Cold service, waited in line for 15 minutes just for a teller to let another customer skipped in front of me , ended up leaving and going through drive thru service. Not a good 2022 start.","Positives:
- The bank branch follows up with customers to inquire about their satisfaction with the service.
- The bank staff is responsive to customer concerns and willing to assist.

- There is a discrepancy in the ATM fee charges, which the customer believes should have been waived. The branch should resolve this issue and ensure that customers are not improperly charged.
- One customer had a negative experience when trying to open an account, as they were directed to a different bank instead. The branch should improve their account opening process and provide assistance to customers directly.

Miscellaneous:
- One customer expresses gratitude towards Pria for her help.
- Another customer had a negative experience with the service, including wait times and being skipped in line."

I'm glad I did!

Rachel assisted me and my co-owner in the process. She was wonderful, courteous and kind.

Took about an hour to establish our new account. Could probably have been faster but our conversation with Rachel was friendly and enjoyable.

- Friendly and professional service
- Greeted with a smile and treated as a valued customer
- Knowledgeable and helpful employees
- Excellent customer service

However, there is room for improvement in some areas:

- The wait times can occasionally be long, especially during peak hours. It would be beneficial to have more staff available or to streamline the process to reduce waiting times.
- Some customers have mentioned that the bank could improve its online banking services, specifically in terms of user-friendliness and features. Enhancements in this area would greatly benefit customers who prefer to manage their accounts online.

Miscellaneous points:

- The bank branch has a clean and well-maintained environment, providing a comfortable atmosphere for banking transactions.
- Security measures appear to be in place, making customers feel safe during their visits.
- It would be helpful if the bank offered extended operating hours, allowing customers with busy schedules more flexibility in accessing services.

Overall, the bank branch receives positive feedback for its friendly and professional service, but can focus on reducing wait times, enhancing online banking features, and offering extended operating hours for improved customer satisfaction."

We need proof of finances of business (they said)
Try to explain again to them that there were none,
Told me that unfortunately they could not help me.

215,Wells Fargo Bank,"1445 Ross Ave Ste 100, Dallas, TX 75202",Dallas,"I recently visited Wells Fargo bank to notarize some important court documents, and I must say, the experience was nothing short of exceptional. The customer service provided by Ashley was truly outstanding - she displayed the utmost professionalism and went above and beyond to assist me. Ashley patiently explained all the necessary steps, ensuring I had a clear understanding of the process.
What impressed me even further was that they even validated my parking, making the entire visit hassle-free. I left the bank feeling grateful for the outstanding service and attention to detail. If you're looking for a bank with exceptional customer care, I highly recommend Wells Fargo, where Ashley and the team will make sure you're well taken care of. Thank you, Wells Fargo, for a wonderful and stress-free experience!This bank location is horrible for customer service. Leadership as far as management is very poor. I was told by this location that they are unable to cash a cashiers check that was issued by Wells Fargo without even viewing the check or asking any questions.

The teller was rude didn’t respond to any of my questions. She then proceeded to walk off and go ask a manager a question that was unrelated to the reason I was there.

Poor customer service and management on this day. Probably not a bad bank but this was the worst visit to Wells Fargo and also the reason I didn’t open a business account here today.

Teller- Alondra Rivera
Manager- Ashley HarperThe staff at this location deserve the highest praise. I went in to establish an estate account after a death in the family. Had the pleasure of working with ""Dood"". Must have spent hours with him over the span of a week doing various things like getting forms notarized that had nothing to do with Wells Fargo. He is always asking how I am doing with everything. And he cracks me up. This is one of the hardest times of my life and good people like Dood make me know that everything is going to work out. Also, Ashley the manager is clearly doing an incredible job motivating the best staff I have ever encountered at a bank. Wells Fargo needs to figure out the secret to the great staff at this location and duplicate it at every store!I paid off my car on October last year and had not receive any communications from Wells Fargo since. I tried to go online but they cut my access to the loan. So I had to call the Auto Loans Department which  I just did. Starting at 10:32am, I called three times and each customer service representative that answered my call didn't even listen to my request and kept transferring me until the system hung up. Finally, the fourth time a very courteous lady named Maya talked to me and got my request solved. She was very attentive and best of all she shut up and listened to me unlike the other three ladies that kept talking over and transferring me to the automated system. My request was finally solved at 11:16am. I'm so relieved that I paid off my car and I hope this is my last interaction with anyone at Wells Fargo. I will never recommend this bank to anyone.What’s is the process or requirements for the cleaning of the ponds?? Is there  one? Is the water clean and chlorinated?I had an appointment today 5/4/2022 at 10:30 am and the banker on duty called me to confirm.  I told him I’d be a little late as I had a chiropractor appointment that ran a little behind. He told me if I could be there at 11:45 am he would be able to get me in. I show up at 11:48 am due to never been there and having to find parking. I sit and watch him talk to someone until 10:56 am and then walks over to me with a silly smerk and says yea I’ll have to reschedule you because you came at 10:48 and not 10:45. Where in the world is the world class customer service? I was trying to bring them more business by opening a new account yet this gentleman couldn’t make the time to get me setup with only being 3 minutes late. I’ll never do business with this branch due to this poor experience. Very rude, condescending and politely unprofessional. Wish I could give him 0 stars!!!Just move to Frost bank.

They do not follow through with anything and your debit card will definitely be hacked using this bank.They never have enough tellers or bankers, or any security guards within the bank.

He was very friendly, courteous, and professional. He seems to genuinely care about his customers. I appreciate the great customer service I received here today from him. I would recommend him for your banking needs. Thank you so much Dustin!I've been using these guys for 10 years and now I'm on the threshold of leaving completely. Tried to open up a business account, after having been told by customer service to do it online and then given an error to come into the office. I came in and was told that I should set up an appointment and that they couldn't do it because there was only 30 minutes left in the day. So much run around so much hassle and no customer service. I feel like I should bank where I feel appreciated as a customer and not a number. If it takes 10 minutes online then why does it need to take an hour in person. I was literally the only one in there and I can see why.Just move to Frost bank. This place is a joke. There’s never any staff and they make the simplest things impossible and inconvenient.

One of those times I waited at the drive through window until I got tired of waiting for a person to come help, finally just drove off. This last time the drive through was also closed and the line inside was about 10 people long.  Why have a bank if you don't offer bank services? I had to drive to the Chase Bank ATM where they charge me for my money and WF will charge me as well, bc that is fair right?  What a disgrace.  I should just move all my money out of WF if they are not going to keep their shops in line.I went into the store on 6535 skillman st in Dallas tx and had the worse experience. I came in just to cash a check .. that simple and the girl behind the counter Aljandra or however u spell it couldn’t even do that. She ran my check into the machine 4 or 5 times because she kelp messing up something in the computer.  And had the nerves to tell me she can’t cash my check now and I’m like how u just gave me $200 and u told me the rest u was suppose to get it deposited into my acct the next day. I said fine then she turn around and did something on the computer and stated now it won’t let me deposit the rest of your check until Oct 6 like how tf and she wanna say it was an issue no!! There is no issue u didn’t know what u was doing and now I can’t cash my check at my own bank 🤦🏽‍♀️🙄or deposit my check and have to return the $200 she just gave meShared my concerns with management.

With rude behavior said he knew, I asked if he had other tellers and pointed at the online working.  Daniel tall heavy guy has no customer service skills. All I needed was to retrieve my own money.

Not a Great way to take care of customers.Here today to deposit coins into my bank account. And Roger helped me with everything and even rolled all my coins up for me. Super sweet and very professional. He made my visit very nice.Do not bank with Wells Fargo… unless you’re into depositing your money into your account and having them tell you when you can touch it. They will hold your money for a ridiculous amount of days with no good reasons as to why.  Then play stupid when you ask them about it. I hate this bank! as soon as they open.. I’m closing my account.Tell that worker lupe whatever his name is the guy with the ridiculous fake nails to loose the attitude and change his tone of voice when helping customers. I don’t know how a bank can hire people like this not coming back to this nasty bank. 😂 …The staff working in this branch is not professional, their attitude are bad and they don’t respect customersThey’re good.Worse atm ever

222,Wells Fargo Bank,"1520 N Cockrell Hill Rd, Dallas, TX 75211",Dallas,"This branch is terrible!!!! The branch manager is sassy and he does not know what he is talking about. I caught him in his lie several times and he tried to back track every single time!!!  Who trains these people, he did not offer to help me with my issue AT ALL. It’s because i am black!! RACIST BRANCH MANAGERDON'T COME HERE. CUSTOMER SERVICE IS BAD. AND ATM'S ARE OLD AND NEVER WORK.Bobby was racist and did not want to help me at the window. Being short staffed is not a reason to lie and say “I can’t help you at the window” and instead made me come inside then processed to help a Caucasian man at the window. This branch needs more employees that are of color or are not racist.Came to make a 8 deposits the comercial light was on and nothing. Next time they should put a sign that it is closed or turn off the commercial light to closed so we are not wasting time and gas waiting.Everytime I come to this location there is one teller and a line ...poor customer service when asking for deposit slips ..no urgency  assist customersMy fiancé has a business account and withdraws money every single week at any other location with no problems, BUT when it came to this location, it has been the ONLY branch to question ownership and I truly believe it had to do with the way we looked on this day. We’ve had this account for over a year and have withdrawn bigger amounts than the one we were withdrawing today. First, the original bank teller said there was a problem with our signature which had never ever happened before with the 10 plus years he’s had a personal account with them and after she had to get the manger, he was very cocky about “being the only one to catch the mistake and knowing a mistake when he saw one” regarding our documentation and ownership of the account. AND it was the longest we had ever Been at a branch for a WITHDRAW, we took less time getting a cashiers check for 6 figures than this. Keep in mind we work outside and often get dirty and greasy and don’t have time to be well dressed to go to a bank and no other bank has looked at us wrong or had an issue with us taking out such a “big” amount every week. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!Been with them for over 20 years and have no complaints!!This place is never open and when it is it's like a Blue Moon It's rareI'm a customer of this bank and usually I do my cashier check at your location. I normally spend a couple of thousand dollars in cash a check a year at Wells Fargo. This morning I was at
1520 N Cockrell Hill Rd, Dallas, TX 75211,
To get a cashier check printed, however after I waited for 45 minutes at the drive-thru Eric who said he is the manager at the branch claim the system was down therefore he's not able to make any transaction. I politely told him he needs to put a sign by the window so that people don't wait for nothing. This was at around  9:00 a.m.
Few hours later at 1:00 I came back again to the drive-thru to get the cashier check made, after I waited another 20 minutes when my turns arrive, the same person Eric he greeted me and I asked him if the system is up and running he said yes and I asked him to get a cashier check printed for me. This time he came up with another reason and he told me that he was not allowing anybody to come to the lobby even though I am at the drive-thru and said he's not able to print I cash your check. I politely ask him why he said due to coronavirus protocol his branch is implementing another rule which is not to allow anybody at the lobby. I say that's fine and asked him to show me a sign at the window that says that and he said he doesn't have one because the branch is constantly changing rules. This is beyond crazy and upsetting for someone who is handling a branch. I run three businesses and I don't have time to go to this nonsense.
Now I'm thinking to open a different bank account at a different financial institutions to do my business.Very poor management! 4 people were helping one customer and still couldn't figure out what to do. I had to wait for a long time. There is only one cashier and she was new didn't know her job.Employees need more training at this location terrible serviceBad service and very rude to customers overallSupremely incompetent and lazy ""execs"", will have to do everything on line or better yet change banks, terrible service in this branch.Very nasty teller at the bank, they will yell at you for simple thingsI'd give it zero stars if I could!!!! This place is absolutely terribleLong wait through drive through.Since inside is closedThis ATM is not good for withdrawing money and I struggled a lot to get it out, that is what they are next toVery Bad Service Starting That The ATM Never Serves You Go Into The Branch There Is Only One Cashier On Friday You Happen And She Has A Name Attitude!! And it still makes you wait more than 8 minutes so I better not come back 👎A disaster !!
On the internet it says the opening hours, it's a lie!! This branch has been closed for months. Only ATMs were working, I went yesterday to deposit cash, 2 ATMs were not receiving cash and the 3rd was out of service.

No one has answered this branch's phone line apparently extremely busy with customers.Good service I've been with them 20 years Never had a problem with they Bank 👍🏾 …This branch is everything a full service bank shouldn’t be. When I walked in the “banker” was busy looking on her cell phone and there wasn’t a teller in sight. As customers waited in line, one finally came out of the back and acted bothered that she actually had customers. After waiting over 10 minutes for the person in front of me to finish their transaction I was finally allowed to go to the window. After asking for my debit card and ID and telling her that I needed to do an electronic transfer she looked at the information that I gave her, rolled her eyes and said she couldn’t do that. I had to go online or do it with a banker, but she was too busy. One her personal phone watching TikTok videos no doubt. I was reminded why I took most of my business from Wells Fargo. Not only is trying to bank through their archaic online site frustrating and impossible, no one at the branches seems to have any interest in actually helping customers. I am done and have moved to a great national financial service that greets you when you walk in the door and always are eager to help with any task. So yes, Wells Fargo it’s not me it’s you.Just went today, 11/26/21 around 10:15am-10:30am. Everyone is always helpful  here and very nice. Today I simply needed help withdrawing money and the two ladies behind the counter were rude. I had first called and they told me they couldn’t do anything about the issue and to call elsewhere (although I’ve had this issue before and was always helped at this location). I then proceeded to come use the atm indoors, and asked for assistance through the atm after it wouldn’t let me withdraw money. The older lady with red on her glasses(no name tag), just let out a loud sigh of annoyance when it notified her that I needed assistance, the other one laughed about it and neither of them bothered to help me. I stood there for over 15 minutes and not one “I’ll be right there”. They kept talking and ignoring me. I ended up walking out. There was no reason for their unprofessional behavior aside from not wanting to be there or doing their job.. which they get paid to do.Declined to give me my money stated that they have to service they customers as if i wasn't one i will be calling corporate on this branchAll 3 ATMs had no cash not sure what's going on but that is ridiculousAlways quick and easy access to the ATM 🏧. …I have been banking with them since 2016","Positives:

I even asked the lady that had me sign alllll those documents, questions about how long it would take to receive it, if it would be the same card number as my husbands.

225,Wells Fargo Bank,"1931 Greenville Ave #110, Dallas, TX 75206",Dallas,"Danny did an amazing job! I’ve never opened a bank account before and was very nervous. He walked me through it and explained how everything works. Such a great experience 10/10 ask for Danny!This is why choosing where you bank matters. I walked in on a Friday 10min before close with an impossible situation: locked out of my account due to identity theft, but needing access to my account for the weekend due to a business project I am managing.

I 100% thought I’d be turned away and told to come back when there was more time to call corporate, fraud department, verify my identity, etc. But instead, I was put in the hands of banker David Gurule who, for an hour, barreled through the necessary steps on the phone with the fraud department and made sure I was going to leave with access to my online account. Bank Manager Danny Gonzalez kept a steady presence on the situation as well, making sure I was taken care of, understanding how important this issue was for me.

Also, from a customer service perspective, they knocked it out of the park. I felt bad/apologetic that I was keeping them late on a Friday - but not once did they make me feel uncomfortable or guilt trip me into finding another time to take care of the issue another time / day.

David and Danny were a great team that went above and beyond to fight for me and take care of an issue when they could have easily told me to come back when there was more time. This meant a great, great deal to me and can launch into the final week of this project (a documentary) without any fear of financial snags.

Thank you so much, guys!!!This Wells Fargo Branch exceeds all expectations. Customer Service, Prioritizing the request or help, and Guiding bankers with the right decisions.
Manager goes above and beyond, and Marissa the teller always has a smile!The worst customer service ever. My wife and I have been account holders at Wells Fargo for 13 plus years. This employee has me looking to start banking somewhere else. Went in to make a deposit also wanted to check into opening a business account. It was about 308ns before closing. So has some questions about it and set up a good time to do it and for me I bring in what documents needed to open it. Then we said ok this check we would like to open a new checking or savings account to deposit this. We did want it in our personal account. She said ok let me go and check on it and be right back. She ame back and said she was unable to open a account for us at this time. I asked why not. Her reply was she felt we were going to use it for a business account I said what did she said because your wife mentioned a business acc and a new reg account ok what does that have to do with anything. She said the way she said it . I then did inform her that my wife does have a speech issue due to mental health conditions. And sometimes when she talks she says her words not 8n order or wrong word all together. She said ithing I can do . It was a slap n the face getting turned away due to having a mental health conditions. So do not go to the branch on Greenville in Dallas tx they do discriminate. I will be taking this issue farther up the chain. Her name started with a C. Not going to put her whole name out there yetThis branch has went above and beyond to help me.

I guess they forget that businesses can't deposit through the ATM.Went on this Sat. No money in the ATM. Traveled to another Wells Fargo, same thing. Other than this, they're great. 💕 OH wait..I forgot something. Another morning, I'm outside in line, awaiting teller to complete transaction and up walks homeless guy to my passenger window to ask for money. Luckily, I press the button to tell the teller about him. She immediately told security. The guy tried to run but security came to the front, saw him and told him to get off the premises! I appreciate the teller and the quick response of the bank security officers. Vagrants are bold now, just come right up to your car while you're at the drive thru! Be vigilant, be alert. Keep your doors locked and windows up!Went there to open account, poorest customer services I ever seen, decided to go back to BANot convenient. Slow. Not good area.Need to put Wells Fargo close to apartments maybe off Great Trinity & Jim Miller people will utilize it instead of the corner store.wellsfargo is a good bank but not in convenient locations and machines be out of order on Buckner too much. And this one is okay .Maybe is just me, but this keeps happening a lot. ATM’s are constantly unavailable.really bad customer service had appointment today at three and basically told me they couldn’t see me today that I would have to reschedule such a waste of timeThey are very slow not trained properlyThe girl was very kind and tried to help even though the language was different, she scheduled me an appointment for the next day with someone who speaks Spanish since they were about to close that day, they were both very kindThe ATMs outside are useless and inside they have only one person attending the window. the line is great! This is terrible... more than 30 minutes just to make a deposit?","Positives:

227,Wells Fargo Bank,"5809 E Lovers Ln, Dallas, TX 75206",Dallas,"WF chat advised I  must visit a branch location to add someone to my account.  I went to this location, found 2 employees assisting customer, and 3 sitting behind the glass doing nothing; 1 man and 2 women.  The man quickly pointed out that his bankers were busy and asked if I had an appointment.  I said no, chat didn't state that was required so I asked if he could help since he wasn't busy (and acted like he was in charge).  He said no, then offered to check other nearby locations to see if I could get an appointment elsewhere.  I will never go here again because I detest laziness and bad customer service!I Love the Wells Fargo on Lovers Lane & Douglas Avenue in Dallas Texas.

How ridiculous!!!Customer wait in line for more than an hour, but one customer came in 20 minutes after I came in and one of the tellers went up to them and help him before everyone that was in line. Worst experience ever. Tellers are not polite, and the managers dont care about their customers. THEY NEED TO GO TO A CUSTOMER SERVICE CLASS. Diana was the one that help the other person first not caring about the rest of the customers that had been there for more than an hour. And besides she was rude.Been with Wells Fargo since 2014. I think it’s time to change bank. They never have enough staff. One teller inside and one outside. Can’t do business like this!This place was closed Saturday morning  when they should of been openI had a bad experience, withing in the line for a long time, there are 4 Windows but only 2 of those were open.Keeping the place in tip top shape as always.Inability to pickup a phone is astoundingLong lines and 2 tellers.Without any people at the ATM at 9am.It was excellent, I recommend well Fargo bank.
In case you don't speak English, they have bilingual staff. You just have to make an appointment and they will gladly assist you.

I really hope the company keeps this branch open for years to comeTerrible customer service. They have a drive thru that is not open. They do have a sign that says drive thru not open. I waited outside when all they did was look at me after pressing the button. They could of just been hey drive thru is closed come inside. I HAD TO CALL THE BRANCH TO BE TOLD I HAVE TO COME I NSIDE. 2 bankers just standing infront of a customer no greeting and just was told ill be with you in just a minute. Completely rude when I get to the counter she did try to make small talk but the whole experience was ruined by the lack of communication/courtesy. They might be busy at the branch but they can't have the courtesy to place a cone or just go to the window and say something. The closest location to the buisness I work for and the drive thru is not an option...?Tameka and Cindy were extremely helpful, knowledgable, and efficient. The times I've visited this branch I have received great service. Always pleasant and professional.This is the worst customer service i ever received from this bank. I went there to get the verification letter of my balance with teller but apparently she had no clue with anything even i showed her the paper i took on my phone and she should be able to recognize it since i believe that not anyone can work in the bank unless you’re trained and have some experience but wasted my time for 40mins just to get the paper. This is example of how teller should be properly trained. No smile no greeting.. i don’t want some manager  to just to reply back like”sorry for your bad experience with us blah blah blah and then we’re strive to give our customer the best experience blah blah blah” just just want it to be fixed and no there was no customer in front of me that time. And two of bankers can’t not take care of small task.. i guess they were just get paid what they’re asked to do i mean.. just your own work and not helping your co worker..All these people working at the bank & only 1 person helping. Hire more tellers!! Ugh.Thank you Sequina for all your help! You are greatly appreciated.Horrible customer service.

They couldn't help me to open a CD and a credit card and they had a wrong information about my date of birth. And they didn't fix it. I spent my day off waitng inside for nothing. I'm still so angry. They're completely inefficient. I'm not sure if they treated me without respect because I'm latino.I never had an issue with this bank until now because they’re new team closes earlier than the hours displayed.Worst customer service you can have within a Wells Fargo Bank. I set a appointment, and got treated like I was not bringing my business to this Bank. Maybe it was a sign that this is not the place to start a business account. Lack of knowledge from representatives Alondra and Roman, then at the end of the day no management within this branch. I will never, I mean never do business here again.went to make a withdrawal inside the branch , everything went smoothly but what seemed very unprofessional is that a non english speaking hispanic went in there and asked for help regarding his credit card one of the lady tellers told him to take a seat that maybe they would help him then all 3 of the tellers started saying rude stuff about the man saying “his one of them “ even though all the tellers were hispanic to untill one of them finally agreed to help the manMy WF branch has been closed due to staffing issues and I needed to wire some funds on Saturday 11/27. I stopped in without and appointment and met Rozsa H. at the entrance and explained my needs. She invited me to her office and very quickly and thoroughly explained the procedure and I was in and out in less than 20 minutes. Rosza is a valuable asset to WF.It is really bad place that managers are really rude and don't see that she have enough experience how to deal with a question about how long it will take for me to changed just a regular check. It took for them to changed my check one hour and fifty seven minutes and she said if you don't like go to another location. That's is not professional and ethical.a very bad service they did not know how to help me and they only told me no and that I should speak to customer service when previous days in customer service they did not know how to help me and they sent me to this branch just to waste my time what a bad serviceHave been to several locations and none of the atms have cashAll BN should only open on Saturdays with the hours of before, we all walk to the race, many of us cannot change our checks.","Positives:

232,Wells Fargo Bank,"4232 Lemmon Ave, Dallas, TX 75219",Dallas,"As far as the services and features of this bank, I had a fairly average experience. I was able to open my account quickly and have had no issues so far.

The reason I came to write this review is the banker who assisted me, Arthur. It’s because of him that, instead of an unremarkable experience, I had a fantastic one.

He was incredibly friendly and welcoming, helpful and knowledgeable and turned the potentially dull business of banking into a thoroughly enjoyable experience.

It’s people like Arthur that make all the difference when it comes to the customer experience. Without his cheerful attitude and competent assistance, there would have been nothing especially remarkable about my visit. I would have simply visited a bank and made a transaction.

I truly hope that Arthur is recognized for his merits and rewarded in every possible way.Rude teller. Not friendly. Asked if I could put my ATM card in for my account and was told it wasn't necessary then teller proceeded to fill out deposit slip for eight checks...waste of time. Then teller said she couldn't cash two of my checks because she couldn't verify. I receive checks on a monthly and bi monthly from these clients so doesn't make any sense. This branch sucks.Scheduled appointment in advance on the app for a very specific purpose of opening an account. Showed up on time, sat down with the ""banker"", stated my purpose again, then learned that he's not the right ""banker"" to open this type of account. Started process only to learn 5 minutes in that he's only taking my information for the right banker to open the account FIVE DAYS LATER.

Went down to the branch on Inwood & Lemmon. Was seen without an appointment and made aware that I didn't even need to come into the branch. My account could have been opened online. Apparently not a single person in the Lemmon branch was able to tell me such basic information.STAY AWAY! Can't even do a smilple job. Need new manger cause Ms. Candi Mendoza can't  her part. Rude and unprofessional.I love my bank and thank you for opening the branch on lemon and wycliff","Positives:

Took an hour to speak with a teller while multiple women were standing around in the back doing nothing.So bad customer service.

Very rude and condescending. Makes me remember why I closed all my accounts business and personal with wells fargo. Went to cash a 200 check from a customer and she asked when was the last time i cashed a check from this customer i said i dont know she took thats as a red flag and immediately started treating me like the check was fraudulent or something . She verified it and still had this attitude like i did something wrong like i said dont judge people casue of how they look because you don't know who you're talking too. That account is my grandfather's I'm going to suggest he close both his business and personal accounts and go to bank of america like you said.I went in to open an account this morning, the banker declined to help me due to her next appointment being 40 mins away.

Ill pass!Doing business with this bank since 1999, this location needs to jump up on the customer service and have a talk with this lady (TAVIA) she needs to learn matters and learn how to respect and treat your customers better she treat me like she was having a bad day , as soonest I pull on the window she gives me this look like rude, them I ask her if she was upsad or mad ......and she respond NO ARE YOU MAD, and grab my stuff and did the deposit , them when she came back she told me here is all mad.......wrong person to have on the window to represent wells fargo , poor customer service on all the ways .Employees are not able to help customers , . Other branches have better options and better servicesHorrible customer service every well fargo has there own made up policies all differentMy mother just had back surgery and had covid symptoms . I took her through the drive thru we notified the teller only to be told that if we wanted a cashier's check we had to come in only for me to go in for my mother explaining the situation again the teller goes to the manager which instructs her to inform us that my mother needed to go back to through the driveway lines and they would be able to print the cashier's check there .... my mother did as was instructed only to be told again she couldn't get a cashier's check only temporary checks which that isn't what she asked for... this process took 2 hours of dysfunctional unprofessionalism I have never been to a wells Fargo and been so dizzy and tired and my mother already in pain was so frustrated and hurt from the experience her blood pressure was raised this experience needs to be addressed so no other elderly customers have to experience anything like this it was a very avoidable experience 💔This is the first I came to this location and the employees here are very nice and friendly I really appreciate that, they’re very professional and helpful and the most important thing they are patient with costumers.

Then, a man came without an appointment, but they let him cut the line. He went straight to talk to the baker for while. A man who was number 1 in line walked in and had to wait. I followed the instruction and had to wait, too.
The text message always replied that I was number 2, and they would let me know when it was time. As a result, I was number 2 until they closed and until the next day. They ever never let me in and canceled my reservation silently.I went there to close my business account and transfer the balance to my personal account. They said It would be a charge for this internal transfer which is disappointing. They also told me that I need to make a call to customer service to close it which I already did, and customer service service asked me to go to the branch. They asked me to wait because the banker  was making a call to know how to do it. After a while I said I changed my mind because It took way too long. The same teller told me I need to again to wait in line to do it. I just left there and am very disappointedFirst I had to wait while 2 guys figured out someone's Deposit slip. Then a Lady came from the otherside and helped me. When she finished the 2 guys were still trying to help that 1 person in Drive thru.  I guess they don't know what Multitasking or speaking to customers.  As give us one moment. Nothing.  No CSR skillsLynnette was a great help thanks for having such a positive attitude and assisting me in my banking needs !!Joanna was very nice and helpful assisting me in setting up my bank account.Bad service

240,Wells Fargo Bank,"11730 Preston Rd, Dallas, TX 75230",Dallas,"DON'T OPEN ANY ACCOUNTS WITH WELLS FARGO. THEY WITHHELD MY FUNDS FOR 90 DAYS WHEN THEY CLOSED MY ACCOUNT.

241,Wells Fargo Bank,"6301 Gaston Ave, Dallas, TX 75214",Dallas,"have banked there since 1978, but also do banking with a lot of other banks.   Overall Wells Fargo has been the most consistent, and this specific branch is most reliable in terms of lobby open and being able to follow through with problems that arise.  Over the years ups and downs in terms of service, but overall this has offered as good service as the various other big banks I have used.  I have both personal and commercial accounts.Avoid wells Fargo at all costs. I've had yall since 2017, I've always heard about them being crooks and i never believed it until now. They try so hard to screw you with all kinds of fees especially overdraft fees. I looked at my account yesterday and it was in positive so i didn't think to go to the bank. I wake up this morning and i have an overdraft fee! For something i already had placed in my account to pay for. Go to any other bank. It might seem good at first but then they'll get you!!No one available for service. Just needed to open a new account. No one paying attention to QR code appt system. Several people waitingIn and out with great service.This branch IS NOT OPEN 24 hrs like google saysIn & out! Excellent customer service ☺️Very rude employees","Positives:

242,Wells Fargo Bank,"18126 Preston Rd, Dallas, TX 75252",Dallas,"I used to visit this bank often and never had an issue. The visit today was so slow and unhelpful. Theres only two tellers. Their drive-through windows are closed. The manager is very ""matter-of-a-fact"" rather than being customer service oriented. Very rude. Will not be returning to this location.The drive through services are closed so we can take better care of people face to face.
-Walking in at noon on a Tuesday to find one teller helping while 3 others have their beds down doing computer work and not looking up while they like of waiting customers builds up.
Great idea closing down the commercial lane too.I would never have opened an account with Wells Fargo after their history of being fined repeatedly for ripping off their customers.  Unfortunately, we needed to switch from a once-upon-a-time local bank, recently overtaken and now instituting insanely high fees.  My business partner found Wells Fargo to be convenient, and so after opening the account, informed me I could complete my part of the paperwork at any branch.

I made an appointment for 10:00 am on 5/23/2020; long after their lobby should have been open like the rest of the Country.  At 10:00 am, I stood outside waiting for someone to open the door for me, it was evident they had no idea someone had scheduled an appointment.  If I had the gall to require an appointment, I would have brushed up on the details and been thoroughly prepared for the visit.  Not only were they unprepared, but totally indifferent.  There were at least two bankers with nothing going on, they weren't manning the ""drive-throughs"", the lobby was closed, and they clearly weren't preparing for appointments.

They claimed, and ""verified"" after 15 minutes by phone that my business partner had been informed of the requirement that we both be present.  What they told him at the time he opened the account is still in dispute.

Regardless, the uncooperative banker I was dealing with refused to deposit a $5,000+ cashier's check because she didn't want to look up the account number.  I informed her that the number was associated with my appointment (since I logged in during scheduling), but I could also provide it, with access to a computer or by letting her login to our account.

She refused, so after an investment of 20 minutes, I demanded my check and ID and stormed out of there; depositing the check at another branch's drive-through no more than ten minutes later... and of course I still have to schedule an appointment with my business partner to be added to the account.Everyone was so helpful and kind. I needed a few different services including notary, and they all helped out where they could. I was signing a particularly long document so they even let me use one of their unoccupied desks to make sure I was organized and taken care of before sending off the notarized documents and check. What a nice group of people, I really enjoyed the service and the care.Arrogant unpleasure manager, absolutely unable do her work. I had some experience long time ago and nothing changed. Save your time and health and go to different bank.","Positives:
- Previous visits were smooth and without issues
- The bank has face-to-face customer service
- Some employees were helpful and kind
- Staff members assisted with various services, including notary services
- The branch provided an unoccupied desk for a customer to use

- Lack of preparation and indifference towards scheduled appointments
- Disputed information provided to a business partner regarding requirements for account opening
- Uncooperative banker's refusal to deposit a cashier's check without looking up the account number

243,Wells Fargo Bank,"13301 Midway Rd #100, Farmers Branch, TX 75244",Dallas,"Went last week to this Wells Fargo because the one by my house was closed, didn’t expect it to be closed in the lobby but after reading the sign they had on the door I went to the drive through. The employees were very nice and polite, I asked them why their lobby is closed since I could see all the people pulling on the doors desperately. Apparently they are short staffed and that makes sense, ever since COVID a lot of places have been short staffed or even closed. Props to them for working in a short staffed job, I’ve been there before and it’s definitely not easy. Reading these past reviews from recently you can tell which people are born entitled, maybe if they care to ask instead of assuming they’d think different. For those like me who don’t mind a wait, this branch is not necessarily an issue.ATM is always down! Such an inconvenience for a branch that’s right off a main highway.Had to deal with a simple matter with my business account. Only 1 banker here and had no idea what he was doing. Seems like you should have a bare minimum amount of competency in order to deal with peoples money.Took my cards and check and form and noped off for 15-20 mins in the middle of the transaction at the drive thru. I couldn't leave without my license or anything until she came back. Sign on the front door says they were closed and didn't answer branch phone when i tried callingYour workers lock the doors 15 minutes before close almost every day and what’s more annoying is this location is closed more often than they’re open. Just go to the other one down the road. It’s nicer and actually adheres to the hours posted on their doors.They don’t make change for non-customers and don’t even ask if you’re interested in opening an account. They just send you on your way after telling you they don’t make change for non-customers. Definitely not interested in opening an account with Wells Fargo after this.Most times I've stopped through, this ATM says no cash available. Also, one still has to schedule an appointment with a banker to enter the building. What a sad location!I walking in to ask if they have a notary, and they do have one, but he was on personal phone call for pretty much long time, he saw me and didn't care he went to another room to finish with his call. He camback to his seat and having another phone call.. totally disappointedHad to wait 1 hour to deposit a check. Had 5 people in line and only one person to help and one person to stare at her doing the work. Not acceptable.Took 8 min  just to deposit 2 checks! No other vehicles were here till after 6 min of me waiting!Atm not working
Only 1 teller stay away really slow I mean slowHorrible service, can’t go in for some reason and the drive through takes forever because workers are too lazyExtremely professional and very quick service.Always slow and umderstaffedI could go on a rant but I won't. Simply avoid this branch if at all possible.Over thirty minutes to withdraw twenty bucks at the window. Awful just awful.Bank is not open. Drive through onlyPlease mark yourself as closed if you are temporarily closed for fire inspection for a few days.very rude and incompetentVery grateful for such excellent service with my account opening. Kimberly García was very kind and helped me with everything!Terrible service and they come out excusing that they are bank policies but they are poorly applied bank policies. You cannot deposit a check just because my second last name was on it when here in this country one is used, previously I had already made deposits with my second last name and there was never any problem, they just didn't feel like accepting my deposit from those peopleDeficient place, only one ATM to attend the car bank and the branch, I waited for an hour for them to give me my money and I was already standing at the window ... it is not the first time that this has happened to me in a #wellsfargo agency with poor service","Positives:

244,Wells Fargo Bank,"13297 Josey Ln, Farmers Branch, TX 75234",Dallas,"It's frustrating enough they stopped staffing the drive-thru on Saturdays, and now I drive up here to make a deposit on Saturday morning and they're not even open in the lobby on Saturday anymore.

The service levels have deteriorated so badly at this location over the past 12 to 18 months, I get the impression Wells Fargo is just slowly letting this branch die and it probably won't be here much longer.First,
They will tell you to go open account online since it is the same thing open in the brand.
They told me my check should be available to use but it turns out a week from the deposit date.
Then you call them but never answer the phone. 3 days in a roll.
ReallyWorst customer service experience I have ever had it a branch waited in line inside 20 minutes only 2 receptionist  with one customer in front of me. trying to get a print out of my statements, The reception is tells me I can  print them at home if I have access online. Then he sends me to talk to a banker waited 20 minutes, bankers are at lunch no customers in there area. They seem chit chatting laughing talking.  I walked out no sense in waiting over 40 minutes for a print out. 1 customer in the branch.Of course no banker would work in Monday afternoon. Silly me.Can I Give ZERO Stars? I've been with Wells Fargo for 15 years. In the last two years I haven't been able to speak to a banker. The hours seem impossible, the ATMs never have cash available anymore. Every other week I have to travel to 2-3 ATMs because they are out of service. I've called three locations this morning and none of them have answered. LOOKING FOR A NEW BANK NOW!The other reviews aren't lying.  Nobody answers the phone.  I've been calling for three days.This bank is totally incompetent - they do not answer the phone, and they do not schedule their staff for meetings!  The do not value their long term customers!  Find another bank!I am pleased to say that the bankers and staff at the Farmers Branch location have been friendly and helpful with prompt and accurate assistance.Long time to get serviceQuick and friendly serviceterrible service!!!Terrible bank, they can never do any paperwork or get an account statement because not even that can give you, they have you hours waiting for a simple account statement and you get the message that their printer doesn't work years of being a customer but I'm already thinking about canceling my account and changing my account. bankI do not recommend it for doing any errands.

I always have the same problem cashing checks.
I have been a customer since 2011 but I have to go to banks in a different county because this bank never wants to make a change. Having a good history, I am a regular customer, but this bank that is 3 minutes from my house I have to travel more than 20 minutes because here at the Farmers Branch Bank they are rude, they do not help, impolite and more !!! 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼Terrible service. I was not able to deposit $300 in cash. Because my ID was not the DL, it hurts that they have that branch so close to my work and with such bad service. 😏The truth is that they do not want to work, you arrive at the bank and not customers, even so if they tell you it is by appointment and they do not assist you to open an account, you have to stop working to open an account with them, what bad service","Positives:

245,Wells Fargo Bank,"3701 Belt Line Rd, Addison, TX 75001",Dallas,"I leave a star and only because the system does not allow me to put a Zero, the attention in this branch is the worst starting with the lady manager or employee who could not attend me because she was going to lunch and I asked her and if the other lady who was next to the office and she’s told me her waiting for a CUSTOMER and she can't, well I replied no problem I wait here, and he did not arrive and this lady was encouraged to attend me but nothing working because she’s told me I had to leave and you can come back later, this is Ridiculous, Inept people with a wrong attitude who don't know that Thanks to us, the clients have Work and food, I'm sorry Wells fargo but Educate your Employees that the clients are no less than them.Honestly if it wasn't for my employer banking here I wouldn't even deal with them! I make deposits pretty much every other day never had an issue until today. After sitting through the drive-thru 35 minutes or longer I was told could not do my deposits because of my paper ID. They need a ID with a picture . I wasn't told that last time I deposited or the time before that or the time for that so why is this new. 🤔 so I remembered that I had a copy of my driver's license ( still in paper form that had my picture ) so I decided to walk-in and see if that would be acceptable. As soon as I walked I was pointed out by the teller Stacy Green ( branch manager) approached me and if in a very negative undertone that my ID was invalid to them because it was on a sheet of paper ( I explained to him that they had done this for me before I was just trying to deposit. I  hadn't received my ID in the mail yet and those were the only two forms I had. He explained if they had done the deposit before it was at a courtesy (well thank you they were very courteous because they did it multiple times this month) oh and they were doing me a favor!! How is that do me a favor? Now I've lost 1 hour at work ,  still going in circles . Stacy's demeanor and attitude was standoffish during the whole conversation where's the customer service? Needless to say I did get my deposit done that felt like I had a jump through hoops I felt belittled. I feels like I had done the Walk of shame at that point I really wish somebody have threw a tomato at me that's how he made me feel. As I was leaving I tried to talk to him I wish he had approached me in a better way customer service goes a long .I personally will never Bank there and with that type of management it explains why the tellers are  never consistentVery very slow service! This place needs more efficient staff or more help. The lines are ridiculousThis place used to have great customer service (2-3yrs ago), not anymore! The waiting time to speak with a banker is ridiculous (45min/1hr or more) and the employees hardly greed you, After calling several times, leaving voicemails without any success or response, I opted for coming to the the office, after sitting at the waiting area for 10+ minutes one of the employees finally decided to ask what did I needed help with. There were not other customers at in the building at this point, the employees were just chatting and laughing in the little glass room. So annoying! Not coming to this location ever again!I had an account in this bank in 2014- to 2017  perhaps .i still have a negative credit report   for an acct that i held for less than a year.
I still do not know what i did to deserve being reported to credi5 bureausVery accommodating in allowing a withdrawal in the commercial line outside, since I had two young active kids in the car! And provided lollipops!Horrible customer service!!! If yoy make an appointment you may want to get there an hr later.Cannot get anyone on the phone at marsh and beltline facility. This is unacceptable. Needs better customer serviceShort staff I waited an hour to get one page notarized.

247,Wells Fargo Bank,"1050 Market Pl Blvd, Irving, TX 75063",Dallas,"I went the other day to close my account with Wells Fargo and the customer service was so rude to me for doing so. They were talking bad about my decision as well as talking bad about the other banking company I am now using. I felt hurt and not welcomed!Horrible customer service. I was assisted by a teller named Vanessa today who was extremely rude and made things extremely difficult for me. I won’t be back to this location and I hope someone talks to her about representation and how to provide good customer service.Met w Lenny Vasquez, banker after extremely awful experience with Grapevine Wells Fargo today with the manager as well as the teller teller’s name was Oscar. They informed me I could wait for hours if I wanted to to meet with a banker or I could make an appointment and it would have to be at 3 PM and if someone was also with the person, the banker at that point, I would end up having to be delayed except for my experience with Mr. Vasquez. I would be leaving Wells Fargo bank with all of my money  accounts. Last Friday I also had an equally unpleasant experience, the brown Arlington Brown Blvd., Arlington location with a teller by the name of Drew. There were 10 people in line and they only had one teller for the walk for the teller line yet they had another teller at the drive-through line and very few cars there waited almost 30 minutes when I explained my concern to him it was he said it’s OK. I explain to him it is not OK but they do not give customer service for people who walk in to the bank to deposit their money today’s experience was excellent with Mr. Vasquez. However, if I continue to have these terrible experiences with Wells Fargo, I will be leaving with all of my accounts.Called to make an appointment for my business account. Person on the phone was rude, and lazy. I asked to speak with the manger? HE SAID HE WAS THE “MANAGER”!
Unacceptable behavior from store manger.Winning the Spain try to get my direct deposit my account number in my routing number I have lost my whole wallet and ID I had my debit card with Ben they will not give it to me I don't know if it's some type of policy but I will not be returning to this bank again I'm a long-time customer for Wells Fargo I will not be returning to this bank again I will go to a different Wells Fargo even if it's 5 mi away fromI almost didn't go here because of the bad reviews. Firstly, the bank was surely understaffed but the tellers and banker were extremely helpful. Special shout out to Robert Knutzen who was extremely kind and helpful to my wife and I who came in with a cranky 1 year old trying to get a bank account opened. He was also helping others when we came in ..Don’t go 35 minutes before they close. They only have one teller to do the drive through and also the front. I could barely hear the teller, she was so soft spoken. I also tried to replace a $20 bill that my dog ate 40% of, and I had 60% of it left. It is still considered legal tender if there is at 51% of the bill, but they would not take it unless I had the rest because they needed the other side of the serial numbers. Don’t go here, their service is so poor.Super slow tellers. Every time. Even when I’m the only one in the drive through.This is the worst Wells Fargo I’ve ever been to. Customer service is non existent. Rey Avila very nicely helped a lady with her cashier check for about 25 minutes. I waited patiently in line for 25 minutes while she did her transaction. No problem. While I was waiting Byron Flores is just sitting in the back looking at me waiting in line. I get up to the teller window of Rey Avila just for him to tell me he’s going to have me move aside and WAIT some more so they could get the line down - the same line I was JUST waiting in for my turn. Rey then makes a disgusting comment about “well they’re paying you by the hour” in regards to my employer on whose behalf I was making the deposits. And actually Rey if you’re reading this no I’m not paid hourly, I am a salaried PROFESSIONAL. I very calmly sat and waited although I shouldn’t have after that rude remark and being asked to move aside when I waited in line just like ALL the other customers. Then Byron proceeds to get up and finally help the other 6-8 people that came in the bank AFTER me. Both of them need to be taught customer service if they keep their HOURLY paid jobs. Believe the other reviews in regard to this branches treatment of African American or non Hispanic people. Every single person they serviced in the HOUR I waited was Hispanic or white. Completely disgusted with Wells Fargo. I will be filing a formal complaint as well. Also, take care of how you speak to people - you never know who’s connected to who and how it’ll affect you later in life BYRON FLORES AND REY AVILA!I had the worst experience at this branch. I wanted to send some money overseas and I know there is an option to do it online but I prefer to do it with a banker as way of double checking the correct number. I was refused service by the one of the bankers, I wasn’t able to see his name but he is a younger Hispanic guy with glasses. I was the first to enter the facility and the banker told me that I need to come back in one hour or wait in the lounge because they are very busy but there was no other customers. I went to sit in my car and see the banker come out five minutes later to take a break in his car next to me getting food talking on the phone. In my head I’m thinking I thought they were busy and it’s not even lunch time yet. I go back in and see this same banker assisting 3-4 guys which showed up and ignored basically refusing service to me. Then the assistant manager came to me and advised me that the banker is “busy” and I should just do whatever I need online. I tried to explain to him that I needed a second set of eyes to confirm I have the correct account number, yet he kept telling me to do it online. If I wanted to do it online I would not go to the bank branch. I left there after waiting 2 hours and not getting what I needed to get done. This was my experience for this Wells Fargo Branch, and I’m very unhappy with the way I was treated.I reached out to this bank over a month ago to set up 3 business accts. I provided my documents and was informed that I would receive a call back within a couple days. I have waited over a month. When I call to inquire about my documentation to proceed with next steps, a younger male picks up and tells me I am unable to speak with Lenny (the personal banker) and that he will relay the message. I wait and NEVER get a call back. When I call again this same young man hangs up on me and is very rude. The customer service is the WORSE I have ever experience and that young man needs to be fired. I ask to speak to a manager and he hangs up or tells me no one is available. How can I do business with a bank I cannot even talk to. I expected soooooo much better from Wells Fargo, this is a huge disappointmentVery slow processing. Even though I’m next in line, they held the line because they are slow. Had to wait over 30 mins in line.This Wells Fargo is by far better than any Wells Fargo I've been to. The service is always quick, the people are always kind, and the drive-thru is always open every time I'm thereOpened bank account with promo offer online. Scheduled transfer at same time which showed accepted.  Also approved for credit card.  I met with Jorge M for appointment.  He told me offer was not valid as transfer was not completed.  Unfortunately he made no attempt to assist with issue. Disappointing experience all around. I had hoped for better from a large bank.Rude only nice to non black people needed change for a hundred dollars  he asked me was I a member I said yes but I didn't have my card on me just got out of the hospital needed change for gas looked Back the next person was non black and he helped them I don't go around stealing money. Will never return to this location..This location has gotten slower and slower.
They only open one drive thru nowEmployees are very slow in purpose. Counting hours I guess.Slowest branch, takes a half hour at least to do simple transactions, bad service.Bring a lawn chair you will be standing in line for about an hr maybe snacks and entertainment.The most incompetent people I’ve dealt with ever.Worst customer service ever. They have a NO for everything.  Only 1 teller all the time 30 minutes wait for every small thing.Stupidest bank in Carlsbad. Couldn't even open a business account. Stay away.Rude ppl and very very poor serviceAlways long wait minimum 15 minutesHelpful and courteous staff. The wait is generally not long.The number of time i went there it was a nice experience and everything was done on time!Worst banking experience , they don’t value for customer time .Terrible customer service. Lazy staffVERY POOR MANAGEMENT!EXCELLENT!⚠️WARNING⚠️ BE VERY CAREFUL WITH YOUR MONEY, OR IF YOU ARE ABOUT TO OPEN AN ACCOUNT IN THESE WELLS FARGO CHAIN, MY FAMILY IS GOING THROUGH SOMETHING VERY SAD RESULTS THAT THEY WITHDRAWN MORE THAN $20,000 IN AN UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTION AND WELLS FARGO TAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS MONEY.

248,Wells Fargo Bank,"1300 N Town E Blvd Ste 108, Mesquite, TX 75150",Dallas,"this location is trash to say the least and Courtesy is not what they live by. Had a fraud rep on the phone to verify me was told to go to the branch spoke with branch manager Downny who didn't even listen to anything I said just kept saying to make an opointment when all they had to do was verify my ID for a 10k wire transfer. Did not want to do it I drove and stayed on the phone and in Garland  off George Bush was able to get help just by walking in and showing my ID with no problem. Mesquite do better! You  should not need an appointment to verify a ID . Customer service goes a long way just remember this is our money and not yours!!!This location is the worst. I deposited a cashier's check, funds should be available same day or next day but they delayed it. The cashier check was paid in cash, it did not come out of a bank account. Funds are there, no excuse of why there is a hold.Been using this bank for many years and they have always treated me well, no complaints. My old bank (Compass) used to hold my deposits and then re-arrange transactions in order to force overdrafts and charge fees, WF has never done that to me once, even back when I was still living paycheck-to-paycheck.They are TRASH they let people steal your money! Don't bank with them they can't afford to protect your money! Bank with another bank WELLS FARGO IS A HEADACHE!!!!!Horrible customer service. I went on to close my account and for some reason the teller tells me my account is frozen. That I should call customer service and try to close my account that way or I could go to the atm and withdrawal my daily limit until I get all my money out. Don’t waste your time.Ok so I'm a daily visitor to the drive thru at this location. I went yesturday and the drive thru was under repair so decided to go inside. It was amazing had 3 employees say hi, welcome to Wells Fargo before I got to the counter. Awesome job on welcoming. Then as I was at the counter Joe walk over an recognized me a the drive thru guy. He made me feel welcome. Way beyond my expectations..(Edited Dec. 28,2022) it happened AGAIN!! I made the original post 5 months ago and nothings changed because it happened again, which tells me they don't take their customers private information and bank security seriously. Currently looking for another bank. Another thing, I wouldn't put much weight on the good ratings on here. I suspect they themselves post them. When I do have time to go there in person, their customer service skills are severely lacking no matter how nice I speak to them and greet them.
(Orig. Post>>>)So we have a mortgage here at Wellsfargo. We sent someone to put some money towards our mortgage because we weren't going to be able to make it in time today (busy with projects). The teller gave this person INFORMATION ABOUT OUR ACCOUNT!!!! When I have called before, my husband had to put me on a list so that I could discuss details with bank employees when needed.
🔴SO WHY DID THE WELLS FARGOS TELLER GIVE ANY INFORMATION AT!!ALL!!TO!!SOMEONE!!WHO!!IS!!NOT!!ON!!THE!!ACCOUNT!!!?????
She was only supposed to take the payment and done. When I have gone in person or called, Wells Fargo always verifies me first to see if I am on the list.
This branch needs to check its employees!!!
0 stars if I could!!!Just told that if I want assistance I have to wait till employee goes to lunch and come back.
Great  assistance from Adriana.I see my reviews are bad have been there four times and what I wanted done wasn't done they were supposed to contact me and haven't it's a pretty sad bank and customer serviceOkay bank, in and out pretty quickly. Didn't realize we needed an appointment to see a bank officer, but they worked with us and we were able to accomplish our mission.If a could rate this bank 0 I would this branch has the worse customer service. I go in ask questions one day the next they are telling me a different day. My checks are being held for 7 days for MY money to be available. I was told I could cash my checks since I bank with them and Now they say I cant. Than they tell me to deposit and they can give me portion of my check I do that and than they day I have to wait 7 business days for the money to be available.  I Call Wells Fargo and they say it was this specific branch that put the hold. Their customer service cant even help me. I also called because I had checks stolen from me so I called to report that and put a stop to those checks two days later those checks are cashed and taken from my acct. I called to complaint and the information about the checks was wrong. Ive been transferred to 3 representatives and none have given me a straight forwards answer about when my money will be on my acct. or what is being done about it. BAD bank and Branch.This place is honestly useless, they are better off closing the branch and saving on the lease. Worst banking experience ever. I have been waiting for the right time to change to my local credit union and I  think it’s time. I have been banking with Wells Fargo for over 11years. It use to feel good to go in to a branch but now it’s like they are pushing the customer away on purpose.wish i could leave no stars, horrible customer service they never answer the phone, ever. needs brand new staff.Came in for a wire transfer, a Banker helped me out pretty quickly and thoroughly while answering all the questions I had. Then I had to get a cashier's check. Waited for about 5-10 mins for the teller to help me. They were all very helpful and considerate to me.Terrible service cannot have a account put in a trust they don't email you they don't care just pretty sadDo not come to this bank establishment join chase or boa even chime do not trust Wells Fargo to hold or make the right decision with your hard earned money. Rude bank tellers, thief’s , janky and have bad management save your self the hassle and stolen/ “lost” moneyThis bank does not offer customer service.  They do not answer their phone, the bankers are really put off if you need to wire money, it was an unpleasant atmosphere. I left, drove 25 mins yo Rockwall. Wow what a difference. They should really close this branch if they make customers so angry.I deal with alot of banks in my line of work and I am sad to say this bank has the worst and slowest service by far.  Don't even think about going thru the drive thru.Very great experience. Staff made everything quick and easy & they’re very professional and sweet! Highly recommend!Jessica is very attentive and friendly!They should have a sign outside stating by appointment only if you need to close an account.Typical inconvenience wells fargo is known for.They could use more tellers.

249,Wells Fargo Bank,"4771 Saturn Rd, Garland, TX 75041",Dallas,"Right now: 29th June. Dumbfounded. Front desk lady wasn’t or isn’t ready to work, told me she needed half and hour to open me a business account when the allotted time was 1hr. She was looking for every reason to have me get another appointment elsewhere, offering to help me set an appointment at another branch and her reason was that business account takes 1hr30mins to open. So I immediately went to book another appointment & got an appointment right in front if her for a business acct opening elsewhere & guess what it was for 60 minutes - I showed her & she didn’t know what else to say. I wonder why someone gets paid to do a job & sees it as a problem, so technically she wants to be free for an hour. Cos she did mention she had someone else coming at 2pm who knows if she’ll turn the person away as well. And I didn’t go late for my appointment, I bet that would have even made it easier for her. I hate to say or think it’s cos I’m black, but love wins. Just an honest review.Worst customer service ever the level of Ignorance by the Representative Yolanda whom has helped us before to deposit our Comdata checks and to act like she’s never done this before is pathetic , we have been coming here for over 1 year and now they way she acts and pretends she doesn’t know how to call in the Comdata checks and literally the rudeness of her is ridiculous. If you work here they should know how to do everything and not pretend she’s never done it this is what drives people away.The worse Wells Fargo I've ever been to. The workers the are rude and are no help at all. Will never go back there again. They wouldn't even let me deposit my check.I can't believe, I wet to this bank whit my sister  for to Open new account and the employee and the manager told me I can't Open new account because she is from Cuba and well Fargo changeed the rules for people from Cuba , I they was wrong, I just opened new account in another well Fargo in Jupiter Dallas , just whit her passport and her social security, sorry but is bad place .Jenny my personal banker took great care of me!

She followed up to confirm my appointment the day before the day of my appointment. Best of all followed through with great service.

I HIGHLY recommend this branch to anyone who will schedule an appointment to open their bank account. 5 star experience!

Thanks again to Jenny and Anahi!If I could give it a 0 I would Jenny Franco is the one that attended me and she is by far the worst banker I have ever had. I normally never complain about anyone but she wants to set up appointments for everything I asked for a notary and she said she was full for months and when I wanted to cancel my account I had to make the appointment by someone else in order to have it canceled.Worst experience EVER. Manager JENNY FRANCO is very unprofessional and rude. I tried to open an account and she said she was booked the whole day. I seated there for 1hr and no clients came to her with no appointment. She was doing nothing and did not took care of me at all. She didn’t even offer me an appointment but to other people did. I feel discriminated by her and wells fargo. Called customer service over 1 hr and still there seated and she had no clients at all. That’s annoying. I understand this goes by appointment but if you don’t have any client you must help other Wells Fargo customers. She doesn’t deserve this job. I believe she is used to treat customers like that. Wells fargo executive branche PAY ATTENTION TO THISThis is my 3rd time back to back coming here the ATM always unavailable, it’s just very inconvenient for me cause theirs not lot of welfargos here always just Waste my timeWorst Location I’ve been. ATM never has cash! Closed on Saturdays. They need a New Branch Management.

I just noticed it has 0 stars for the past year in a row. When will they fix the problems with this location.My uncle Gilberto was trying to deposit his paycheck at Saturn Branch. Service was rejected due to his mexican ID. He's been with Wells Fargo for over 3 years, never had any issues until today 11-25-2022 with this racist clerk.I was quickly greeting by a banker... not a teller.  And she was not friendly.  She almost seemed like she didn't think I would have an account there.  Her demeanor made me feel uncomfortable asking for help setting up a digital wallet.   Her attitude was rather rude in my opinion.Credit card statement late, ATM broken, after waiting in 2 lines for over 20 minutes I am asked to continue waiting to get a printed out oh my last and late credit card statement. I am giving up and leaving their branch.They are very rude....after sitting in the drive thru line for over 20 min when I got to the window the lady said they were closeThe banker lady Jenny set appointments for more than a month but at the end they never attend appointments even if is urgent just in this location in any other location I been attendedChange the people who are in the commercial area, I stayed in the line for more than 30 minutes and there were only 2 vehicles in front of me, what a bad serviceI call this location at least 3 times a day. Nobody ever picks up the call. I keep having to call other locations just to get to speak with a banker.Worst bank ever can’t even do a basic change order with cash in hand without a computerLack of customer service... Every time.Everything is okay.Fix your ATM.That bank is useless, they charge you for overdrafts even if you have a balance there and when you make a claim for a collection that is not authorized, they charge you the money and they do not want to recreate it, they charged me 105 for an overdraft that supposedly they were going to recreate it because it was not my fault and I guess they could not return that money to me I do not recommend it that bank is a thousand times the chase bank 100 x 100 betterExcellent service, everyone helps you and solves your doubts, especially Miss. Ariana, thank you so much for everything.
Something important to spend with an executive you must make an appointment online or by phone, what I must thank is that to all the branches that I call to resolve my doubts, I only answer the call at this branch, which adds value to this branch in particular .
All staff are bilingualTerrible service in all aspects, you call them and they never answer and then when you go to the appointments the employees do not want to do their job and if they do, they do it reluctantly 😡I will never return to this bank, we went for the fourth time with an appointment and they did not attend to us because there was no appointment and then they give the option to make an appointment through a call, you stop doing your things to waste time with themBad attention","Positives:

250,Wells Fargo Bank,"3432 W Buckingham Rd, Garland, TX 75042",Dallas,"I wanted to take some time and let everyone know that this is the best bank ever. No matter how busy the tellers are they always greet you with a smile and professionalism. I've read some of the reviews and from my personal experince today I can say that unfortunately the clientele of this location are arrogant and entitled. The amount of criticism these tellers are receiving is disgusting. The tellers here are hardworking and should be receiving praise. If you dont like the pace of their work then go to a different location. I will gladly keep using this location in the future.I literally have an account here and came to get a paper sign for work by a notary. Lady with short highlighted hair was no help said her license expired today. She could at least told me where to go for further help! Worst customer service everWith most of the other locations in the area closed on Saturdays, why can't this one have more than 2 tellers working? Especially considering the line consistently reaches all the way to the exit.The banker told me to wait because she she has an appointment, but she grabbed a lady who was standing in the line and helped her, they are very toughNo words always a line literally only two tellers the slowest bank in the world I only stop here because close to my job hate itGreat place to bank. Has 2 atms and inside is always nice and clean.Really disappointed in this location. Bank tellers just don't care of your time. Just make a cash withdrawal took 40 minutes in the drive-thru.My goodness, this is probably the worst WF brunch I ever visited. Its Tuesday 10 AM and not really lots of people and I am literally waiting for more than an 1.5 to talk to a banker. There is just one banker lady who is literally on her desk for 5 mins and then gone. What a joke. I would probably take my 15 year long business with WF to somewhere else just because of this kind of horrible customer service.i do vending machines for a living. I have a business checking account with Wells Fargo. The bank tells me they can only take $100 in quarters that were already rolled. I went to a different Well Fargo. I will never go back there. They should be glad that the tellers and manager at 6535 skillman saved my business. I will never go back to this bank.Been sitting in the drive thru for more then 15 mins, and still haven’t even been greeted. It seems like they are always under staff because they always take forever! Nothing compared to the location off Garland Avenue and George Bush!!Worst experience ever.  Waited 45 minutes in the drive through to be told I had to come inside.  Inside there were at least 15 people standing in line.  Save yourself a headache and your precious of time and use ANY OTHER BANK.Do not bother to visit this location, the tellers took forever to process a simple deposit transaction. It feels like they do not need your business here and they doesn’t give a value on peoples time.The absolute slowest bank experience of your entire life you might as well pack a lunch bring a blanket and pillow cuz these people are in no hurry whatsoever to do absolutely anything.Horrible service. There’s always one teller and takes foreverIf you like waiting 30 minutes for 1 teller go here. There’s 4 people (“that work”) just standingIt is really disappointing when you meet personnel don't have answer to your simple request. Why an employee spent much time speaking Spanish with some customer while don't want to spend one minute with other customer. Be professional1 teller to 11 customers. This is crazy!!!These tellers are slower than sloths.It’s the worst bank location I ever seen it and really have bad costumer serviceThe service provided is very poor and slow. It shouldn't take 40 minutes for somebody in line to get service.Horrible,  take forever, never again , love my allen branch and n.dallas branchVery very slow services. I had waited for a several hours for deposit 🥺 …1 teller. Really? My other location near home is 2xs smaller with 3 tellersI don’t understand why they take so long to countThe line is always too long.The worst customer service for a bankWorst bank in the WORLD!!!Rather pushy n rudeThey are always very slow. Bad service today the cashier just needed to ask me for my dog's pedigree. We need them to be more agile, they take a horror today they were even sending me for my husband, I only wanted 200 dollars and he made such a show of me, it took forever to It's like going out to bring my husband and nothing that I don't already take out.","Positives:

251,Wells Fargo Bank,"3300 Preston Rd, Plano, TX 75093",Dallas,"Lady at the counter is beyond useless.
Went in to find out where my wife’s replacement debit card is after it was supposedly sent overnight yesterday. The lady said they can’t help me with that and told me to tell my wife to call the 800 number. At this point she hadn’t even looked up the account or anything. I asked if she could go ahead and pull up the account to see what it showed, but she told me she would only do that for my wife. She then refused to believe that it is a joint account that both of our names are on, and is still refusing to take my card, info, or ANYTHING to look up the account.
I also stated that I needed to make a withdrawal and she decided to ignore that. When I finally had enough of her uselessness and terrible attitude, I politely ended the conversation and began to leave which she then started mumbling things at me behind my back.

100% do NOT recommend coming here for anything that you need help with.

ATM works great and doesn’t have an attitude though.This place seems understaffed, I’m sitting in line every time for 30 minutes waiting on someone to help me. Mayra Elliott, at the counter, is extremely rude. Whoever is managing this place needs to look into a different career because this particular branch is a headache every time…Worked customer service ever. The 2 lady’s today there doesn’t know nothing
I was there for 25 min and neither of them could resolved me. In the end I left without solving and I went to another branch and they was able to solve me in 5 min.Went here because it was closest to my house and my normal banker is 20 minutes away in Frisco. Guy I interacted with was a grade-A D-Bag. I have three companies with Wells Fargo and two mortgages yet the consumer banker I spoke with had no interest in assisting in the slightest. Had everything I needed resolved when I went to the Frisco location.Made an appointment, not that it mattered. There’s no directions where you should go and there’s no one to talk to. I had to stand in line for 10 minutes to speak to a teller. Complete waste of time. No one was ready to see me for my “appointment.”
I understand being understaffed, but the manager ignored me and played on his phone the entire time. It wasn’t until I complained that he bothered to help me.","Positives:
- ATM works well
- The branch is conveniently located
- One of the employees at another branch was able to assist the customer quickly

- Customer service at the counter needs improvement
- The branch seems understaffed, resulting in long wait times

252,Wells Fargo Bank,"212 Coit Rd, Plano, TX 75075",Dallas,"Went to the preston branch first, where I was told that they have shortage of bankers in that location. I asked the lady that if it is necessary to book appointment to open a new account as when you try to open the account online, there is a mention somewhere that you can just go to the nearby branch. She replied that it is not mandatory and I can go just walk-in any nearby location. So I went to this location where fortunately there was a banker available but she will not be able to open an account before afternoon or have to come other day. I believe it is super inconvenient if the bank you are keeping your money has no walk in service and every time there is a requirement of appointment, specially for a bank with Wells Fargo’s stature. It would be completely understandable if it was the peak COVID period but now it sounds completely stupid. I have/ had accounts with Chase, PNC before but never had to go multiple branches for any reason or leave without fulfilling the need, which was in this case.SEPTEMBER 01-2023
🤬I understand that they have a closing time at 5pm.🤬🤬 I arrived at the branch at 4:50pm.🤬 Wow, they already had the doors locked. They should change the schedule and say that the doors close half an hour before.

This junior banker nearly cost me my home closing after botching a cashiers check and then accusing me of presenting it somewhere else after he messed it up. Clearly an understaffed incompetent bunch there. Another Wells Fargo easily performed what I asked them to do after this guy said my entire home deposit was already cashed somewhere else.

254,Wells Fargo Bank,"120 W Main St, Mesquite, TX 75149",Dallas,"Don’t expect them to pick up the phone. Don’t expect to set up an appointment same day or same week, don’t expect any service!!!!!! This place is awful. And you walk in there and sit forever and they’re not understaffed and hustling. They just don’t care about their customers!

And before you people post an answer saying how sorry you are and how much you care—don’t bother. Just start doing your jobs!!!!! Pathetic. Nobody wants to work anymore!I personally like Wells Fargo as a bank.  I also invest in this company because I believe in thier business model.  The reason I gave 1 star has to do with one teller Kenya.  Just horrible customer service. Looks like she just hates her job or thinks she is better then the customers that ask for her help.  Makes no eye contact and does not even greet.  I've given her 3 times within a 2 month span to see if it was just a bad day and service was worse everytime.  I even watched customers in front of me that she helped.  Management please address this.POOR Customer service at the Mesquite, Town East location. Had an appointment schedule well  in advance plus inform back in details my needs.  Receive a phone at 4:57 pm day before, to tell me my appt was CANCEL. Bank close at 5:00pm. I did receive text confirming appt and I would reply as confirm!!!                                     VERY UNPROFESSIONALInside Long lines & only one lane. Inside no better. Branch mgr could have cared less.This branch is so terrible, lazy and frankly a joke! Apparently, you can't just walk into the branch and wait to speak to someone about something, you will need to wait around appts, even if they are between appointments. We watched the bankers eating and socialize with each other while walk ins have to wait to see if their appoint shows up in 20 mins. Seriously, no one had a current appointment for 20 mins and they just walk by us like using their banking service was some sort of gift! Seriously Wells Fargo, there are tons of better banks! this bank makes me rethink why we have wells fargo! It is funny how the branch on the other side of town couldn't believe what we told them  about this branch, as they had zero issues working us in between appointments. Bad customer service all around at this branch. Good thing there is one good Wells Fargo in this town! Beware if you need to go inside, go to a different branch! Never forget what makes your brand special! This branch needs to be reminded.I'm giving them a star so I can give my opinion about this branch they dzav negative zero horrible is the word bunch of lazy employees here how can people be waiting to be attended to while you sit comfortably in your office  doing nothing just waiting for appointments of people who are not even in the bank make it make sense because it doesn't employees here are horrible and lazy go else where if you need your business done period.I’ve been coming here for years and for the first time I had a horrible experience.. if you come just make sure you do not deal with Jaqueline Randolph White, she will mess up your transaction and not care about what happened I have no idea why she even got hired.. very disappointedIt's Saturday been sitting in line since 11:10am it is now 12:10. Horrible customer service. This is just sad. It's like this every weekend. 30min per car. Something has to be done at this location. Both branches in mesquite suck.The costumer service here is the WORSTTTT. Young lady with glasses and braces was The RUDEST PERSON EVER. I left so mad i forgot her name 😒 …Once again, these ATMs been replaced already. They have 4 ATMs and only one is working. This place is a joke when it comes to ATMs. I owe the IRS 214 dollars. The IRS took their money from my account. That's understandable but Wells Fargo charge me 50 dollars for them letting the IRS take money from my account. So I paid a total of 264. My time is coming to an end with this bank.Worse branch ever, rude, tellers are so rude and they don't know anything about customer service. The manager branch was just walking around even when she saw a long line.Manager knows which days and hrs are very busy...Saturday 1 pm 10 people in line and not moving at all..2 cashiers...These people do not answer their phone to ask questions!The place that make me go hmmmmm.I don’t recommend this bank how they steal I found that all transaction you do on weekends they make numbers on Monday and they get all the money possible from that transactions on weekends very carefulWaited an hr to be told i need to make an appointment!Bad service !Everyone is awesomeThey are always extremely niceA1 Service got what i needed.Rude staffClean, friendly, professional..Love this bankI had an appointment scheduled and I was there since 10 am and my appointment was at 10:30 and the representative attended to other people just because they knew each other then just because they know each other and favoritism as whoever says we are already doing things regardless of the rules and if I know you I attend you quickly and those who have an appointment to wait do not care they find an excuseI made an appointment at this branch, I arrived early, and even so I could not open an account, very bad service, it seems that they do not want to work, Mrs. Gloria Rangel is not kind at all, very despotic and does not help at all. I give this bank one starTerrible service in the customer service department, 30 minutes waiting and only for the woman, with little professionalism and unfriendly, to come out and tell us that she would ask us the reason for our visit, that we need to because maybe she wouldn't be able to help us, there is and that we would have to do it somewhere else, well when it was my turn, very unfriendly she reluctantly answered my questions, (the saddest thing is that she was Hispanic) Terrible service, Wells Fargo your staff needs more training regarding the work they are doing and about all more kindness to customers.","Positives:

255,Wells Fargo Bank,"2970 Horizon Rd, Rockwall, TX 75032",Dallas,"Banks will be banks, meaning that they are in the business of taking your money for anything and everything. Begrudgingly I use them till the day we all are using blockchains. Despite people's complaints, I have banked with Wells Fargo for over 20 years without incident.  My feelings on banks notwithstanding, I had a fantastic interaction earlier this week. I needed a form notarized and Mrs. Keri Grant was an absolute gem. Just like her male counterpart (Cary Grant), she was charismatic; very lovely. She was also very knowledgeable about my banking needs and even provided her business card to follow up on my next steps. If her coworkers are half as competent, I would recommend visiting this location.We love it! Every interaction we have had here has been inside the bank, and each time it has been super fast, efficient, and an overall great experience. Highly recommend - enjoy/disfruta! 💯🔥😎💪🏽 …Waited in line for 45 minutes to withdraw. There was one male teller working. He was having problems and was on the phone, im assuming to get help. Other employees were walking around, and I asked a female employee if there were others that could work as teller. She just looked at me and pointed to the male teller and said ""hes working"" then walked away. The manager finally came out to help the working teller, this is when the female employee finally opened up her teller station. Management needs to know about this. Looking at their current 2.4 star rating should tell them something.Taylor, the branch Manager was absolutely FANTASTIC to work with. She was available short notice, extremely efficient, thorough and spent the required time to get a complicated task done. Glad I have all my business and personal accounts in Wells. Confident I am in good hands.The teller was extremely rude I’ve needed had a bank tell me I can’t get my money from them but I can use the atm lol and she HAD to look at where my money was coming from RIDICULOUS and very unprofessional she didn’t even know how to do her job she had to call someone else over how can you be rude and incompetentThe bank sucks in general, the phone support doesn't communicate with physical banks to synchronize service and rules. I was told over the phone that my wife can add a person to the account without me present, when she came to this location they said that she can't. I asked for a reimbursement for wasted time and gas, but the greedy bank can not even afford a penny. Horrible customer service. The rating of the bank on Google is the true picture of the bank's relationship with its customers.Came in on a December weekend with an appointment to exchange USD for Mexican peso for an upcoming trip. An African-accented lady met us and essentially told us that they don’t offer that service there and that we should do the order online. She was also yelling across the lobby to one of the tellers (who was helping a different customer) asking about our case. At the end she told us to just go to “do the currency exchange at the airport like I do.” After leaving, we tried to do the order on the app which told us that we can do it in person at the bank. We returned right away and this time we went to the teller. Thankfully, the teller was a different lady who wasn’t there in our initial trip and she helped us order our currency exchange. It turns out they do offer that service after all.Went in to pay off my auto loan with a check my bank issued to me (refi). The teller told me the check is not a normal check so I need to see a banker. Somehow Wells Fargo only takes appointments to see a banker. Teller girl was asking other teller if there’s any other way and could tell that she’s trying her best but the other teller, a black lady, didn’t seem to care at all. They just told me to make an appointment which is not available same day or next day. I can see a banker in the branch was not even with a other customer. But no help and Only my daily interest accruing. Though This is why I’m refinancing.
.
.
Update: went to Rowlett Beanch today and they had no problem taking me on. Banker and tellers were all nice and they weren’t sure how to proceed with the check I had but banker asked the branch manager for help. After all, teller could just process it and he apologize for rockwall branch.
Recommend anyone to go to Rowlett branch. They are much more helpful and you don’t need appointment to see a banker there!The tellers in this bank are so kind. I have witnessed twice how they go out of their way to help older people.I have been a Wells Fargo customer since 1996, and wanted to share my experience with the Rockwall Branch.  First, most companies take on the personality of its leaders and Taylor Riccardi, the Branch Manager is outstanding.  She has personally helped me with my business accounts as well as my personal accounts, answering any questions with expediency.  I have had the opportunity to also work with two bankers at this branch. Both Skyler Jackson and Paula Thibodaux worked diligently to make sure that we crossed all of the ""t's"" and dotted all of the ""i's"", and have been instrumental in making sure my business banking has run smoothly.  This Branch should serve as an excellent example of how all of Wells Fargo should be run. They are very alert to customer's needs and I really appreciate that.Keri took care of our issue with ease. She exactly what to do and set our mind at ease.Why did you remove the drive through ATM? Chase across the street has 2 drive through ATMs! Dumb move.

Update: they did put it back!😁This branch is very slow have all these folks working but only 1 teller to help people. The branch manager hasno operational
awareness. See a line should probably help. But this place seems slower and more unorganized than most other branches.however joe the teller always awesomeErnis at front desk just saved my day of his professional service, all glory to him. I been in Terrel branch same day before and they couldnt find me solution. Ernis did, thank you very much brother.To much time on driving thru
4 lines how many taller
Horrible service 😑 …My husband attempted to cash a check we received from an Insurance company at this Wells Fargo Bank due to the check being from Wells Fargo and our current bank being out of state. The check was for $7,000 - he was told by one of the employees they do not keep that kind of money in the bank and that they would only be able to give him $6,000. My husband asked if they would give him a check for the remaining $1,000 and he said no. Basically, we would lose the $1,000!? I am not sure if this employee was trying to rip my husband off and pocket the $1,000 or what exactly would happen to this $1,000?

I would NOT trust this location.Very unprofessional! Went in for my appointment to set up a savings account. As soon as I walked in, this african accent lady across the lobby yells ""Can I help you?"" i just look and stare as others are looking at me. I walk up to her but she didnt have the manners to come up at all. And I told her I had an appt at 2:00pm. Guess what? she said ""ooh um yeah we are very busy today will have to cancel it"" and immediately hands me a card and say ""scan this to set up a new appointment"" I just walked out and decided ill be closing my checking accounts very soon!Fix your ATMs or get out of the banking business. I’ve been a member since 1996, and have never had a problem anywhere else I have lived except for here. Multiple times I go to the two ATM locations in town and at least one is not working. Fix your ATM’s !!!!This location is terrible. I took off work because I had an APPOINTMENT. I have been sitting here for an hr now and have yet to be seen. No updates no nothing just told to wait and unsure how long.I opened my account with this branch about 10 years ago, and have always had a wonderful experience. Service is quick and tellers/bankers are always very friendly!Noone it's ever in their offices, went 2 times to open a checking account, they dodnt help me. They act like we own them favors and we are bothering them!Saturday 11 am...15 people in line and did not move 2 cashiers open....I had to leave..Drive thru has 3 lanes plus business lane never wait more then 3 minutes amazing service … friendly tellersTerrible service always a 30 min wait . Always other tellers watching each other . It is patheticReally bad service, not professional at all, has no knowledge what they should doWhy make an appointment then wait for over 45 minutes to be seen.

256,Wells Fargo Bank,"2601 Lakeview Pkwy, Rowlett, TX 75088",Dallas,"Check order - ordered checks.  Got a.fancy checkbook cover, charged $45 - and still no checks and the rent is due.  Seems I ordered a fancy cover for rush delivery.

I will still to Old School and go into the lobby to order my checks.  Paying $45 on a retirees pay is harsh.  😢Worse customer service ever. Wonder why it’s still opened. Bankers are not helpful at all. I wish they will do something to make this bank is better!!!The service at this branch is hit or miss. What's the point of having a QR code to see a banker if no one is checking it? I sat for about 15 minutes and no one ever came to get me.They suck. I will continue to rate every one of their businesses with a one.. no one solves your issues. Ive been with them 5 years. And all for nothing..it sucks when you build your history with a bad bank. It's not convenient whatsoever.. I can no longer dispute over the computer. Just so many iasues no help.Not too customer friendly. Had us to wait until he came back and said that he would not be able to help us today. At 3.00pm,closing at 5???Not the most professional location

Connie with the white  flip hair should really tighten up on her customer service skills. Always rolling eyes, not presenting all service & product options based on her preconceived notions, rude responses and improper greeting compared to the other tellers.  Sighing ""What am I doing today"" isn't how you approach customers who have been with your bank almost 20 years.
WF has been slipping in many areas as of late and her snooty attitude is another strike towards WF before i head to Chase and take my accounts with me.First of all people ..... you might want to do your homework on this bank ....
The most crooked, unethical bank in the country !  They have been sued and fined so many times for their illegal and shady business practices, why in the world would you want to put your money with a bank like that ?!?!?
Secondly, speaking from my own past experiences even before their legal troubles, I was a long standing customer but chose to quit them because of their rude behavior and the total lack of customer service !
I will NEVER do business with Wells again !  You shouldn’t either.Drive thru ATMExtremely slow. Just got skipped in line, super annoyed !!!","Positives:

257,Wells Fargo Bank,"4040 N MacArthur Blvd Ste 200, Irving, TX 75038",Dallas,"Got placed on a waiting list just to be told by Personal Banker Angel (15 mins later) that he is fully booked and probably won’t be able to attend to me today. You should probably inform ppl of that before placing them on a waiting list.You have to make an appointment to get someone to take care of you, me and my friend came here to open an account and we arrived 5min earlier, our appointment was at 10:00am, they told us to have a seat and is already 10:10 and still nobody has taken care of us. Why do you make people get an appointment at a certain time if the bankers don’t want to take care of them since the bank is empty right now and they are literally doing nothing. If you have other things to do please don’t come to this location since they’re going to make you waste your time.Their ATM is always out of cash and the drive-through window always closes. If you  anything like me. I don't want to come insideSeemed inexperienced and I had to do my transaction at the ATM in the heat outside. They also def need some kind of shade at the ATMWells Fargo Bank is clean and has a pleasant auro abut it each time I visit.  There is an auto telleroutside and I usually use it - works well.Not sure about Wells Fargo's normal standards. No customer service to greet you when you walk in. Went 2 days in a row, just not what a normal Wells Fargo bank experience is usually like. Hopefully I the future, they will have enough employees to be able to service customers like other branches. I will not return unless it is to use the ATM. Not worth the frustration.Incredibly slow. People working here just standing around. No one doing work

Back again 3 months later. This location might as well close. I’ve never been to a slower bank in my entire life. Not even close.If you like being told a different story/excuse every time something goes wrong this is the bank for you!
If you like not being able to cash a well fargo check at wells fargo this is the bank for you!
Lastly if you enjoy horrible customer service at their branch this is the bank for you!The service they give for their customer is super bad, and the staffs are very mean, and has a bad attitude. I would never come to this bank againUnreliable customer service. Spare an extra 30 min after entering this bank. They feel proud of their customer service but keeping customer wait for hours.They don't know what to do with international transactions. bad serviceWalked in and immediately felt uncomfortable from the stares.

Annoying n irritatingVery good branch and located at a beautiful place. The stuffs are very friendly and always ready to help.This place clearly needs more employees. Took 25 minutes and two lines to find out they could not be of assistance. This place is garbage.

258,Wells Fargo Bank,"4156 S Carrier Pkwy, Grand Prairie, TX 75052",Dallas,"Cashed a check here and received money I couldn't spend anywhere. Went to 4 different stores and even tried to deposit in my bank account.  No-one will accept this fake looking 20$ . They gave me two of them but one actually took when I tried to deposit in my account.  Why not pull this bad money out and get rid of it, instead of giving it to customers that need all of their hard earned money.I had the most wonderful experience here with an Associate Personal Banker named Nasean McCray. She went above and beyond to help resolve my situation. I had a very specific situation and she even called up to upper management to ensure we had the correct information. The first time I came in we couldn’t completely resolve the issue but she tried her absolute best. The next day when I came in she was about to go on her lunch break and she still even stopped to help me before going. She was extremely professional and gave some of the best customer service I have had in a long time. It is rare you get service like I received with Nasean nowadays.They are the closest bank to me however, the service is not always to great. The last time I went there I had to wait about 2 mins while a lady was giving training tips to a teller. I have a basic checking account with them and hated to hear that they charge for their temporary checks and certificates! (Other banks don't)They literally don't want you there. They quickly referred me to another branch and did not pay attention to my worries. The employees acted like they were doing me a favour by referring me to another branch.
Fixing to close all my accounts because of this horrible experience.Didnt help me resolve anything that I needed! You need an apointment for everything in here.. Came to the location in Pioneer, and even though they actually have a lot of clients, they solved all my issues without an appointment and with a smile on their face. Will be going to Pioneer from now on.Always a pleasant experience Ms McCray and the other associates makes you feel so welcome. Will recommend every timeWILL NEVER BE GOING TO THIS WELLS FARGO EVER AGAIN.

Ummm... Is there an option for 0 stars?

HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE ALL AROUND.

* 2 ND TIME AT THAT LOCATION TO CASH MY CHECK, SAME PEOPLE AT THAT WELLS FARGO LOCATION.

APPARENTLY THEY COULDNT CASH IT EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE ALREADY DONE SO BEFORE.

259,Wells Fargo Bank,"4000 Legacy Dr, Plano, TX 75024",Dallas,"Understaffed on a Saturday. Disappointing. I suggest they hire more bankers or open more branches when customers want to be served.  I was told to come back on Monday when there will be more bankers available , …. but this is when I am working, and it is not as convenient for me.I really don’t like leaving a negative reviews but I scheduled a appointment for today to open a new checking account. But the banker Michael rejected my application. I had two forms of identification drivers license and work permit and my social security. An still this guy rejected my applicationI recently reviewed this Bank the Review has been erased! I opened this account 3 months ago and on the 18th I deposited a 5500 dollar Cashiers Check. Cashier checks are guaranteed! It's basically like taking money to a bank. I was told that I should be funded by the next Business Day. While there I myself asked for a 8k cashier check from my own account.  Knowing I had to purchase my new trailer by Wensday to ensure it didn't reach the auction. What is a simple transaction at any other bank has become a 2 week long hold. As a Minority business owner this doesn't sit well. I've been warned how Wells Fargo treats minority  customers and that's what this is. Very disappointing and  Wells Fargo is very unapologetic they could care less. And they speak to you as such. I'm sorry put this is policy.  Yes policy for you guysJuly 14, 2022
At 3.30PM I tried to call the branch at Legacy and Coit to make an appointment to go and send an overseas Wire transfer and phone rang and rang until it rang off. Is the bank so poor that they have staff to answer customer calls or did the operator die in her/his chair? WHAT A HORRIBLE BANK!!!  I am sure the smaller banks care for their customers better.
Periaswamy Balakrishnan.Most useless people works there, no bankers or manager and cashier taking forever to “help” people. They just told me to do the transaction online or through the appThe WORST location for bankers!! 7 out of 7 times I have gone in for various business needs, they have turned me away because they are booked for the day (by 9:30am), under staffed, or just too busy. It’s clearly a management and business culture issue. Save yourself the headache and just go to Frisco instead!!Banker guy was standing there taking a picture of himself and said to my face that he didn't have time to sign a paper.I just wanna know if these guys have a coin machine so I called them and waited on the phone for FIFTEEN MINUTES bro wthGood service","Positives:

260,Wells Fargo Bank,"131 N Denton Tap Rd, Coppell, TX 75019",Dallas,"Tried to do a wire transfer. Wells Fargo was on the phone with the bank it was going to. The bankers talked. The wire was sent but it did not go through (not that I was notified). Wells Fargo will not give me my $30 fee back, because apparently it's not their fault if their bankers don't know how to send a wire. On top of that I had to drive to two different Wells Fargo to get an appointment. What a waste of time and a waste of trust. Would expect a lot more from a big bank like Wells Fargo.

Update- Due to Angel's response below, I contacted them again and they were able to make my account right after all. Still think six interactions, including three trips, does not constitute a good review, but bumped them up to two stars.THEY WILL HAVE YOU WAIT AND WAIT… nobody services you. They have BAD customer service. I had an appointment and they let someone in front of me. They are short on staff or something because there is only ONE banker. This is ridiculous!I should have read the reviews here before I came. The teller was very rude and I felt like my being there was a terrible inconvenience. I overheard her conversation with the banker, who was equally rude, so they're not just rude to their customers, they're rude to each other, too.I have been a Wells Fargo customer for many years doing business in several out-of-state locations. However, I have avoided the Texas Coppell branch due to its poor customer service. Unfortunately, I had a need today to follow-up on an application I made on line. The bank was empty. The teller, who was immediately joined by the drive-in teller, seemed bothered with my questions. As I turned by back to walk out of the bank, I heard both women laughing at me. This is completely unacceptable! Manager(s), Please don't bother to reply to this message, which undoubtedly, would be the same canned response given to your many unsatisfied customers. I urge you to send those tellers back to customer service training as it is obvious the women did not learn anything the first time. I gave one star because there is nothing lower.Avoid this location at all costs.     I ha e nothing but issues every single time I try to bank here.   Numerous times they have not had the staff to allow overrides to take money out or even deposit checks.   They have put money into the wrong account and have wasted way to much of my time.   I have tried to be patient with branch but they are complelty incompetent and the only reason they get 1 star is because 0 is not a option.I scheduled an appointment for wire transfer at 4:30 PM but had to wait 40 min until someone volunteered to help, so even if you scheduled an appointment and you got all these confirmation texts and emails still there is no guarantee that you will be served, imagine all this technology we have today and they still can not make it, Coppell is deserving more than this, this poor customer services will bring this bank reputation down but looks like they don't care, one of the biggest banks in the US has short staff!
MY QUESTION IS: If I am 40 minutes late for my appointment, will they excuse me and provide me with the service I want? I'm sure they will not.Pathetic service . I understand there can be delays but even after waiting for an hour and being patient , you are not helped with something that just takes 5 minutes,  it’s just not acceptable.I walked into the Coppell, Texas branch to open a new account.  I was told that all bankers were in a meeting and that I'd have to wait 20 minutes.  I chose do leave and not work with this branch.  Why make the client wait in the middle of the afternoon?  If a client is in the branch you stop what you are doing and help them out.We were told that we needed to schedule an appointment to open a new account. The first available appointment was about a week away. I scheduled an appointment, and have now been waiting over 25 minutes pay that appointment time, still not having been helped. The tellers cannot estimate when the banker will be available for the appointment. This branch will probably close, given the lousy customer service and lack of staff.Not ones or twice but always this Wells Fargo coppell branch should win worst customer.Worst customer service by teller , I went to deposit check and the teller lady told me that she can’t deposit check because her manager is not here , next day the same story , I went to other branch in Irving , they deposited immediately without any manger approval.Thank you Phillip for helping me and my friend with a notarySo disappointed with Wells Fargo with this branch. Teller was rude. Manager didn't care. I won't be going there again and will go to another bank.Worst bank never staffed and customer service is the worseThe young manager does not implement policy among staff.Love the hardworking team hereVery poor customer service.","Positives:
- The bank was proactive in trying to resolve the issue with the wire transfer.
- One employee named Phillip provided helpful assistance with notary services.
- There is a hardworking team at the bank.

Room for improvement:
- The bank needs to improve communication with customers regarding failed wire transfers and provide appropriate notification.
- Wells Fargo should consider refunding the $30 fee for the failed wire transfer.
- The bank should address issues with customer service, including long wait times and rude behavior of employees.
- The branch should ensure they have adequate staff to handle customer requests and avoid mistakes such as putting money into the wrong account.
- The bank should prioritize customer service training and implement clear policies for all staff members.

Miscellaneous:
- Several customers had negative experiences at the Coppell branch, which has led to a poor reputation for the bank in that location.
- The bank manager did not address the concerns of a dissatisfied customer, indicating a lack of accountability.
- The customer experiences described in the reviews suggest a need for improved overall customer service at the branch."
261,Wells Fargo Bank,"2912 Legacy Dr, Plano, TX 75023",Dallas,"I came in for the 2nd time to close my father's account after his passing (the first time I was turned away because I only had 30 minutes and was told it would take much longer). It took an hour and a half on hold with the back office in order to close the account. I've worked at financial institutions for 11+ years (2 of those at Wells Fargo), there is absolutely no reason it should take an hour and a half to close a single account when I had provided all the proper paperwork to do so ahead of time. The back office had received and reviewed my paperwork the week prior and had decided to freeze the account since I wasn't able to stay in the branch for the full hour to close it the first time. Because of that, it took even longer the second time because they said they were having trouble removing the freeze. The freeze should have never been placed to begin with because there had been no transactions on the account in 9 months and I already had an appointment to come back days later to close it. The woman on the phone was aware that I was sitting in the branch waiting for her response and yet she still kept us on hold for nearly 90 minutes. The customer experience around this transaction was just ridiculous. I would never recommend anyone bank at Wells Fargo, ever.Do not Bank Here Ever! Opened a Business Account 3 months ago. Simply deposited a Cashiers Check.  Was told by the Tellers Id recieve funds the next day. Needing to have another cashier check for 8k like I withdrew that day. I'm a small business owner and had an opportunity to buy a new trailer before it went to auction.  Not only did they but a hold on a  Guaranteed check they moved the time to the 27th from the 18th before they would fund it!  They are unapologetic they do not care for the small businesses that frequent they are establishment. There is an excuse for everything but no answers. And as a minority Wells Fargo has a bad reputation this only proves my point They are what we thought they were! #TrashIf you are going to temporarily close a location, mark it so on Google. The company I work for charges $125 per hour, a 15 min detour to a temporarily closed (unmarked) bank cost them $31.25. This needs to be a MANDATORY corporate policy for all managers!Best banker ever .She is so helpful and fast.","Positives:
- The banker mentioned at the end of the text is described as helpful and fast.
- The company is urged to mark temporarily closed locations on Google.

Room for improvement:
- The customer had a negative experience when trying to close their father's account after his passing. They were turned away the first time and had to spend an hour and a half on hold with the back office to complete the process.
- The customer also had a negative experience when depositing a cashier's check and faced multiple issues, including a hold being placed on the funds and a delay in receiving them.
- The second customer mentions that Wells Fargo has a bad reputation, indicating a potential issue with the bank's overall reputation.

Miscellaneous:
- The first customer expresses their frustration with the customer experience and states that they would not recommend banking at Wells Fargo.
- The second customer expresses dissatisfaction with the bank's treatment of small businesses and mentions being a minority customer.

262,Wells Fargo Bank,"7900 Woodbridge Pkwy #179, Sachse, TX 75048",Dallas,"Horrible experience. It's 100 degrees in Texas. This is the second time my husband a black man was advised about making a deposit outside! He informed the same lady that it was hot side and he didn't feel safe considering the amt. He is a business owner! Why is it a issue for him to make deposits inside of the bank. I have called the bank several times to speak to the branch manager and no one answered the phone!!!!Please inform your employees that depositing money in the ATM is a optional to your black 🖤 customer not a priority!!Although this location has limited banking services, I've utilized it a few times in the past.  However; I had a very unprofessional experience with Garrett during my last visit.  I informed Garrett that I needed a Cashiers check and asked if my daughter could use their restroom as we had been waiting some time for assistance.  Garret stated NO our restroom is for Employees only....WE suggest our Customers use the Coffee shop restroom down the road.  I informed him that during a past visit a Banker allowed my daughter to use the restroom.  After hearing this he stated....well that must have been a manager...I requested to speak to a Manager and he stated that the Manager is gone for the day.  I requested that he call a Manager.....after talking to someone for about 5 to 10 minutes...he said his manager said NO.  I left to take my daughter to a restroom at another location.  When  I returned, Garrett was talking to another Banker and stated would you like that Cashiers check now...I stated that I would not need his services and would like assistance from the other Banker.  Also, I suggested that Garrett read the online reviews for his office.  He stated that he does not look at the reviews.  In my opinion, Management should address the poor Customer service issues provided by some individuals at this location. What should have taken 5 to 10 minutes ended up taking over 30 minutes...a TERRIBLE experience.  PLEASE DO BETTER Wells Fargo and REVIEW the VIDEO!Today I had an appointment at this branch, I arrived before the time of my appointment and Garrett very kindly attended me, he helped me open my new bank account, he explained everything and listened to my doubts, despite having read the bad reviews here I was a bit skeptical but Garrett exceeded my expectations honestly he seems like a wonderful agentBankers have no idea what’s going on - also told me that I would get a debit card within 5 days - it’s been 11. Was never mailed out. Can’t deposit cash - Wells Fargo is garbage.I've been to this branch twice.  The first time, I was trying to set up bank accounts for my kids and the banker didn't know how to do it.  So strange.  The next time, I was trying to deposit some checks, a money order, and some cash and was told they ""don't do cash"" here and that they don't have a teller.  A bank that doesn't do cash?!  What?!I don’t understand why they have a atm if its never working!!I find it funny that you cannot deposit cash into your bank account.convenient location and lots of free stuff inside pens, candy’s for kids and key chains….It was great experience. Roberta provided me great serviceVery helpful, you can't even deposit at the ATM 😡","Positives:
- Garrett provided excellent service during one customer's visit, exceeding expectations
- Convenient location
- Lots of free items available inside the branch (pens, candies, key chains)
- Roberta provided great service to one customer

Room for Improvement:
- One customer had a negative experience with depositing cash, being advised to use the ATM instead
- Lack of knowledge and unprofessional behavior displayed by Garrett towards a customer's request for a cashier's check and restroom access

- Complaints about the ATM not working and inability to deposit cash

Miscellaneous:

263,Wells Fargo Bank,"900 W Airport Fwy, Irving, TX 75062",Dallas,"Great experience with the bank teller. She was very energetic, chatty Kathy, and knew her stuff when it came to the paper, cheddar, dough, mula. Etc. Pretty neat how they had yellow foot prints outside to lead you inside. I couldn’t help myself but to say follow the yellow brick road, click my heels, and look for Dorothy. Only reason it wasn’t 5 stars was because I wasn’t greeted when I walked in and bankers were at their desk W/O a customer. Also the area for deposit slips was not organized, Slips were all over the place.2 tellers with 12 people waiting. Employees walking around. I would understand if they are short staffed but there’s 8 people. Wells Fargo, we need to be better or open up another location in South Irving. I have been with this bank over 15 years. Makes me concerned about investments.This is by far the worst bank I’ve ever been to. This drive thru line hasn’t moved in over 45minutes. It’s nice to see that Wells Fargo does not give a single ounce of care about its customers.This bank has continued to decline over the past few years. It's Friday afternoon with only one drive thru open. Where are all the bankers? I think it's time to look for a different bank...It takes to long in the drive through and it's sad when your card has been compromised they can't give you a temporary card, just took many inconveniences with today's technologyBeen banking here for over 20 years. First time to get rude supervisors. I watched while both had to approve deposits and withdraw and never acknowledged the customers. So when it was my time the clerk was friendly but she needed approval and the supervisor came and he did not even look or say anything. I know it's petty but people need to learn what customer service is.Each and every time I come to this location for the drive thru ATM which is a couple times a month it does not work!! It always says it is out of cash so annoying and inconvenient.Natalie was very patient and helpful. It was my first time at this location, it was very busy but I made an appointment online and was seen on time.I go to this bank daily. Normally great service but Today the girl in the drive thru was RudeHow about -5. Pull into the drive-thru at 4:55. (Yes, pushing it, but I work and school, so it was an in-between stop.) Wait in line until 5:10. Pull up and they try to tell me they are closed. Asked even though I was in line before 5?! They tried to tell me that they liked outside and seen no cars in line at 5. Nice try. Then I asked for a money order, Nope, can't do that trough the drive thru, has to be inside only.... 😒 🤔 been trying to figure that one out... Can give money to deposit, can withdraw money, but can't get a money order.. planned on going inside at first, but there was no parking spots available. I resorted to the drive-thru, and then got ignored, lied to, and then still couldn't complete the transaction. 1st time having to use this location, and won't be back.By far the worst location.   The accountants don't know what customer service is.   They will ignore you till they have no choice.   Schedule an appointment and you might be lucky enough and only wait for 45min.  Instead of walking around saying hello, provide some service.   How hard is it to get a new account or replace a lost card!!  Seriously.  The Wells Fargo is Southlake, Colleyville,  and Grapevine are so much better trained with providing good customer service.  No I will not email you all my personal info so I can get a target on my back and get worse treatment whenever I go in to a branch.Drive thru is EXTREMELY slow….it doesn’t matter what time you come; be prepared to waste at least an hour to two hours of your day sitting waiting.  What business owner has this time to waste?Nataly is the best ! She understood the problem and got right to the solution I would recommend talking to her !This place doesn't even deserve 1 star and the Manager has a I don't care this is all I can do attitude. The worst Bank in the state of Texas. It took me 1 and a half hours to cash a check written on this bank. I will never accept a Wells Fargo check again
Now I am being asked to give them all my personal details . Address email and other sensitive information without any explanation as to why. They are crazy.Worst Wells Fargo branch ever. If you want to waste 30-40 minutes of your day waiting to deposit, then only go to this bank. Branch manager needs to hire more tellers or help the customers himself/ herself.This branch has helped me with several types of transactions. With or without an appointment their team of employees go above and beyond what is necessary. I just want to make sure that all of them from their greeter, tellers, business account manager, beneficiary account manager, notary, and many others who acknowledge customers who walk into the bank and make sure they are taken care of. This branch is by far superior in customer service.The worst customer service I’ve ever encountered hands down! The lack of professionalism was extremely appalling. In his attempt to converse with us he ended up insulting us.The guy that helped us by the name of Angel Merced Valencia definitely needs further training on how to to treat loyal customers and what not to say. He definitely crossed the line in more ways than one.Worst Wells Fargo I've been to.
So slow and don't see people in order at drive thru.
Someone needs to do something about this instead of just reading these negative posts. Ridiculous!There are about 15 people in line inside and they have 1 teller open. Pretty ridiculousThe lady at the front Shasi is very helpful, friendly, and professional.Not only am I displeased to find out there is no public restroom, but the short hispanic woman who came out to the lobby area to  LOUDLY say there was a public restroom next door was to say the least embarrassing. Clearly this location is not about taking care of their clientele. Horrible experience.
👎👎👎👎👎 …They definitely need to bring the tellers from the branch they closed down on Beltline and Northgate.  Great bank, not enough tellers.Quite possibly the slowest bank in the United States ha.... Usually because it's just too busy - but even just a few cars in the drive thru means 30 minutes. Block out your entire afternoon for a visit. Often I can't even get into the parking lot - cars are backed onto the highway.Very rude and unprofessional customer service.
I took online appointment and I was number 2, I waited for an hour and no one was helped, when I asked they told me that they are organizing the appointments, the whole bank had 3 customers !!There is 3 people before me and I been waiting for over 1 hours and still I’m waiting and they call 2 people so far there is guy he just coming and go immediately to the office no one call him I believe he know the guy who work for the bank one of The worst location for Wells Fargo bank I will never come back to this location!!!!!!!Went this morning to deposit and drive thru closed,so decided to go inside to find out it was closed due to weather and people waiting in the atm room told me they are waiting for them to open but no one was inside the bank,sign also said opening soon,so I took off and come to find out Wells Fargo is the only bank closed,all other banks are open but not Wells Fargo,I have been with Wells Fargo for over 20 years,I have never seen it like this ,poor service,every time I have gone there lately I have had an issue with Wells Fargo bank just not the one in Irving tx but everyone I go in lately,so disappointed,I think I have a choice to make with Wells FargoVery bad service on DT open 3 or 4 lines  & sometimes only one coworker attended 4 lines that ridiculous your waste time  is lake 2hrs  or more omgWorst wells Fargo Bank ever.. do not come here if you are on lunch or have any more plans for the DAY… you will be here for at least 2 hours..Always a long wait, employees standing around talking. They don't prioritize their customers. Very poor service!Omg this Wells Fargo takes soooo long I been sitting in line over 30 min smhThis bank is so slow and they argue with customers. They seem that your a bother to them....Israel was very nice and informative.ATM did not dispense my money and they denied the claim! Thanks for stealing my families money! Do not use this bank or their ATMs!One star should say it all, I’m going to chase from now onLong lines, and employees are having a good chat in the back. Disrespectful & disgustingDon’t recommend the branch lot of waiting time to get the consultation service from banks representativeBad customer serviceAtm has no cashWorst service ever.Never answers phonebest serviceBe careful Hispanics above all, in this bank they are stealing, I went to pay $1000 in cash to my credit card and the cashier took the cash I gave her and at the same time took another $1000 from my account, I paid $1000 to my credit card and the other $1000 was stolen, I filed the complaint and they never resolved anything, the only thing they did was call me from one person and another to tell me that they could not see anything and that They will continue investigating and to ask me the same thing and the same thing, the cashier is still at work and my money never appeared. Please save yourself your regrets or apologies that they only do it to appear here.Very bad service I have 20 minutes waiting every day this gets worse, they should hire more staff... because the boys need support.There is almost always only one cashier and the wait becomes eternal.⚠️WARNING⚠️ BE VERY CAREFUL WITH YOUR MONEY, OR IF YOU ARE ABOUT TO OPEN AN ACCOUNT IN THESE WELLS FARGO CHAIN, MY FAMILY IS GOING THROUGH SOMETHING VERY SAD RESULTS THAT THEY WITHDRAWN MORE THAN $20,000 IN AN UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTION AND WELLS FARGO TAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS MONEY. DO NOT TRUST THIS BANK PLEASE HAVE YOUR MONEY WITH YOU.🙏🏻They never answer and you go to the bank in person and they ask you to speak, they don't answer either in person or by phone so how am I going to fix my issues very bad serviceVery bad service and the notaries do nothing to serve their clients.

264,Chase Bank,"2121 N Pearl St Ste 150, Dallas, TX 75201",Dallas,"The ATMs here are often down after hours. I let it slide for AT LEAST 8 times (for 2022) before posting this.

265,Chase Bank,"11611 Preston Rd, Dallas, TX 75230",Dallas,"I'm a mom with a toddler, I came to use the atm at 5:15 pm with tap on my phone, the bank had closed at 5, the bank manager Nathaniel was walking out and helped me figure out where to scan even though it was after hours and 2 associates were really sweet and helpful as well. Amazing customer service and super thoughtful and helpful! Recommend this branch 10/10I love Chase Bank but this is truly the worst branch that I’ve ever experienced.  I called to see if they had notary services and asked if I needed an appointment.  I was told they had 3 notaries and to come in any time.  I arrived at 1:50 in the afternoon and was told  that THE notary was at lunch and I would need to wait 20 minutes.  The tellers were rude, dismissive and completely unhelpful.  Go to the branch at Preston and Royal.  I will never go to that one again!Very disappointed with what transpired with this branch. Showed up to handle banking during regular business hours, checked Google which verified they were open prior to going. Showed up to everything closed and a ""closed"" sign on the door despite the fact the bank was supposed to be open. No walk-in ATM access for a circumstance such as this, the one ATM outside is drive up and does not have choices of bills to distribute which would make indoor ATM access ideal. Another Chase nearby is listed as temporarily closed so I hope this one gets it act together. Not sure how long I can remain with them if they are not reliable.dont waste your time there, they are very rude and even with an appointment, they are not available","Positives:
- The bank manager and two associates provided excellent customer service, even after closing hours.
- The bank has a tap feature on their phone for easy transactions.
- The reviewer recommends the branch with a 10/10 rating.
- There is a mention of another Chase branch that is recommended.

- The reviewer had a negative experience with a notary service, as they were told to wait for 20 minutes for the notary to return from lunch.
- The tellers were described as rude, dismissive, and unhelpful.
- The branch was closed during regular business hours, despite Google stating that they were open.
- The drive-up ATM does not have the option to distribute different bills, which is inconvenient for those who would prefer indoor ATM access.
- There is mention of another Chase branch being temporarily closed, which raises concerns about reliability.

- One reviewer highly recommends the branch, while another strongly advises against going there.
- A mom with a toddler was grateful for the help received from the bank manager and associates."
266,Chase Bank,"4709 Ross Ave, Dallas, TX 75204",Dallas,"I met a very good banker named Janie at the Chase bank branch - 5177 Richmond Ave, Houston, Texas some days ago. She is very professional. She could answer all of my questions by a very simple way.  I am a foreigner and my English is not good. That's why I appreciate her so much. The bank should raise her salary now. Thank you Janie.They are shut down because they don’t have an A/C? I was told by the lady that was there this location doesn’t have an air conditioner not that it’s broken. They don’t have one. Yet they still made her and a security guard come in???? I guess they’re just closed all of summer???? Im changing banks. What a joke.Poor customer service. My mom went in to open an account and was told to make an appointment for the next day? She was asked if she was a citizen or legal as well. Also, the bank was empty meaning it was only 3 customers. It doesn't make sense, but what do I know I'm not in the bank business.All 3 of these stars go to Karla- no other unmotivated employees at this branch. I arrived at 12:10 today to get one page notarized during my 30 minute lunch break.  A teller checked with the manager and told me they might not be able to do it because people were busy or about to go to lunch.  One was going in 10 minutes and another in 20 minutes.  I told her it would only take 5 minutes.  It seemed like lunch was far more important than customers.  Karla told her that if I could wait until she was finished with another customer,  5-10 minutes, she would help me.  Thanks again to Karla!  Someone please provide some leadership and customer service at this location. 😐I think the people are great at the shop. However, the ATM machines are always down. Maybe it is related to the area and vandalism, no idea. I do need to get frequent access to my cash and would like my bank to have functional ATMsNot this locations fault hence the 3 stars but I hope it gets attention for future customers. Chase froze my account after depositing an insurance check that took 6 months to get which honestly wasn’t even that large- from notably awful Falcon Insurance. So I understand their hesitation, but that’s not on me. I found this out on rent day. They froze my general funds. I was not NOTIFIED per what I understand is procedure, by call, email, or text. So no food or bills able to be paid. Customer service essentially said “sowie” and directed the conversation elsewhere. When will it be unlocked? Their answe: eventually. Which is obviously not acceptable for an answer. SO, I took it to contact customer service through email. Who directed me to the people that were not helpful. Chase does NOT have your back and is not looking out for the customers. As far as I am concerned, my money is stolen and I plan to close my account once everything clears. Beware!Was told their banker was ""done for the day"" and that they worked on a first come, first served basis. Didn't offer to set an appt or anything. Went back the next day, and was told the bankers couldn't see anyone that day, and that they work by appt only.Had an appointment with Karla at 330p to open a business account. After an hour of waiting with no update or apology for waiting. I left! Get better Chase. Business is earned not given!!Had to withdraw some cash by teller cause the ATMs were down. Teller with the plats/dreads said she was not open, look up she’s asking for the next customer right as I get to the teller that was busy with a customer. Hump day, I guess.Karla helped me open my student checking and savings account. I was blown away by her outstanding customer service. She was very professional & it didn’t take long at all. I’d highly recommend this location & Karla H.!Unfortunately I bank here I went inside to try to open a savings account and the cashier that came out to help was very rude she said they couldn't help me right now because the only banker they had doing this was busy, she would let me know how long it would take for them to see me she never came back to let me know because she was too busy in the manager's office visiting and the manager saw me standing there didn't bother to say anything either bad bad customer serviceThe ATM's at this branch are a joke. Including the Kiosk and ATM inside the bank..
Always out of service or malfunctioning...
CHASE please do better !!!Love that when even the bank is closed we can still do emergency transactions in the lobby
Thank you so muchWhat's the purpose of having ATM machines that won't do anything? You can't deposit money checks withdrawal etc... What's the purpose of this Branch?Out of the 3 ATMs available only 1 is working. The line is very very long.Dont understand how ratings are so low I guess because it's in a bad area of dallas but been going here for 30 plus years very nice and friendly staffVery kind attentionAtms need to be fixed!!!!!a very bad serviceAtm closed!Classiest and racist, customer experience very undesirableJose was totally awesome today.Terrible service, they have very poorly trained people who only waste your time and do not give you the necessary information or help","Positives:

The employees at this location were so kind, helpful, patient, and accommodating. Thank you!!Chase put a restriction on my granddaughter account without letting her know.

More impressive is that for the past 4x in two years that I needed assistance, Jonathan Saavedra is always there to help. Talk about keeping employees happy to serve.Thank you Vanessa for making my transaction an easy one, for your patience and the 🍭 🍭
Kudos to you for such outstanding customer service 👏🏻 …I come in to this chase several times a week to make deposits for the doctors office I work for. Employees are generally polite, greeting at door, telling you where to line up, etc. However, I walk into bank and greeted at door and am happy to see I am first one in line. There were 3 people leaned against wall off to side, which is usually for atm. Greeter says something to them in spanish then asks me to back up and allows them to cut in front of me rather than having them get in line behind me. One teller and those 3 individuals all had deposits to make, one with a shoebox full of cash and coins. Why didnt the greeter direct them to proper line when they entered instead of chit chatting with other employees? Or, why have them get in line behind customer who was already in proper line? It was rude, extremely rude.Just wanted to say Mrs. Maria has great customer service ! Took care of me and went beyond, had a great visit at this Chase branch. Keep it up 👍 …Went Into the branch to close a account and the teller had no customer service skills, no compassion, annoyed. Her body language spoke volume, I left the branch with nothing accomplished. The women did not have a name badge either, she was careless. She worn a grey cardigan, blue shirt, brown hair. The worst experienceATM machines never work whoever is reading these messages since the manager at this Bank cannot get it done can you please come fix these ATM machines please!!!!! The outside ATM machines have been broken for over a year nowWorst customer service I have ever experienced in my entire life..The employees are RUDE and UNPROFESSIONAL!!!!!!!Rarely has their drive up ATM's working. 9/10 times they're down for maintenance and it's 50/50 on their ATM inside the building.They have two ATMs and one of them is always out of service!!

272,Chase Bank,"2945 Walnut Hill Ln, Dallas, TX 75229",Dallas,"This bank location is a joke. The employees are racist and treat Hispanic people horribly. They really do, just see a Hispanic person and immediately assume you’re broke. How crazy is that?! They talk to you like you’re an idiot. Complained to the manager who is also a joke, talking about “im so sorry”. Didn’t even get my name for the complaint, he said he would just “memorize” it. 🙃
Find another location, or a different bank, point blank. One who actually cares for the customer and not just judge based off your appearance.Worst experience dealing with teller “Gabriella” have gone several times to open a business account with a scheduled appointment and for one reason or the other she cannot help us. She is very unprofessional the way she handles taking care of customers and the manager doesn’t seem to understand how managing is done.

Then a saw a lady and ask for help and she was so rude with us I didn’t see her name .Let me start off by saying that the staff during the weekdays are very kind, professional and attentive 100%. This is not the case on Saturdays.  I am in this location 3 days a week to make business deposits for our sports bar. I find it hard to believe that just because i did not have my account number i could not get change for $300. i attempted to give the lady our LLC etc and she shrugged me off saying i can only get change with an account number. How is it possible that with our business information we cannot be found in the Chase system ?Pretty ridiculous that it says online open until 5 but their only banker has left for the day and it’s just now 4? So I then am asked to set up an appointment to start a bank account because ,again, their only banker has left already. It’s okay I’ll start with someone else.Phone service is trash. Good luck getting a short question answered.This branch is full of unqualified employees! Don't go here! They don't even know how to look up your account.

274,Chase Bank,"6437 Hillcrest Ave, Dallas, TX 75205",Dallas,"I'm assuming that Chase has all the business it can handle because clearly they don't want mine.

I've received countless offers over the years with promotions to move a business checking account to chase. Problem is, you cannot do it online and I promised myself I would never set foot in a bank again...

...but, recent offer was sweet enough that I thought I'd call to find out what I would need to bring (certainly don't want to go twice!), how long it would take, best time/day...

...Called 5 times, couldn't get a human, everyone ""busy helping other customers"". Tried the Preston Center branch, same thing. Just for fun (and to make a better story for me to share w/ folks...), I tried this branch 8 more times. No one ever answered, even though I pressed the option for ""Open New Account"", which would be high priority, right?

I've tried very hard to give Chase my money, but they don't want it.Jason Williams, branch manager is the man. He’s able to deal with complex trust issues like a pro. I highly recommend this specific branch thanks to Jason.Left another Chase bank to come to this one to do a simple transaction(The other branch was happy to not help or find someoen to help). They were helpful and professional at this branch. Will only come to this brank now. Also, not a very busy branch so less wait time.This is my first google review ever - if I could give it less than one star I absolutely would. My business account was deleted (without my knowledge) along with all of the funds in it. They then would NOT release the funds back to me because they didn’t believe I was the owner of my business. I’ve had to go back into chase 5 different times now - STILL trying to get MY money back and apparently no one can provide me a written guarantee that the deposit has been made because their emails “go through an approval process”. Going on 8 weeks without the money in my account. The banker helping me was Mclaran. DO NOT recommend this location whatsoever.Staff always very helpful and niceNice people","Positives:

Victor was told to reach out to someone else from the back to confirm the ability to deposit. He left me there for 5-10 minutes when he appeared he didn’t bother to acknowledge me. Did the deposit and slid the receipt across the counter. I asked if there was anything else and he just stared while shaking his head.

Drive-through banking is available, and the branch is closer to The Village Residents.Do not go to this Chase Bank because they like making excuses on mistakes that they make. It is not worth going in there and making mess ups on your transactions and the more they mess up. They try to explain to you about the mistakes that they made or either mistakes or they are about to make. So do not go to this Chase Bank on Greenville and Southwest. Go to another branch before you make a mistake and putting your money in thereWent to get a paper notarized and the lady who was trying to help would not notarize because paper did not said to notarize it. She would not even consider it notarize it. When asked what she meant by it, she did not understand and did not had any explanation besides that it did not say “notarize me”.

I have had many papers notarized including my ID etc.. never heard of that before.Soooo BAD. Worst bank experience I have ever had. I went to make a payment on my account and the teller said she had no idea how to do it??? Her manager was close to her and did not even come over to help her? The teller also had no clue to ask someone how to do the payment? It was acceptable to them to not help the customer with a simple payment. I went to another Chase a few miles away and was in and out in less than 5 min. They knew exactly what to do. I'm about to change banks soon. I was not surpised to see this branch rating is 2.5 which is very bad. They deserve worse.These comments speak volumes! If I could give it 0 stars I would, by me giving it A star at all is generous 🤭. Where do I began well, the Branch Manager is a ACT, me being generous again. The LAO , is Lost by far. I do not recommend working here at all. I was an intern here for about 2 months and it felt like a circus 🎪. My heart goes out the customers who bank here.🙏🏽As a JPMC employee, I’m extremely disgusted and disappointed with the attitude of this staff. Very condescending, and unhelpful. Attempted to cash a check from the bank and was told I couldn’t due to a “limit” for non Chase customers? Sounds completely unheard of. I’d never ever come back to this branch to do business. Their lack of willingness to assist even potential customers is very telling. Unnecessarily endorsing someone’s check without their consent is also a big no no. Very unprofessional and disappointing.The Branch Manager (Sharita) was excellent. Though she was with another client, she came over to inform us she would take time to help us within a few minutes. We got all our needs met, and she was a very pleasant person to deal with.I met with a banker name Joel. He helped me set up my business bank account. He was so friendly and very helpful! He is now a friend of mine.That location has the most professional bank manager I met in Dallas I went to 4 different bank manager's spent about 15 hours on the phone with the customer service and still no one was able to solved my problem. Only she could figure out my issue.

Then she went to call another crush who spoke Spanish and she said that she had to call a translator and that it took an hour to answer the call ..!

279,Chase Bank,"8928 E R L Thornton Fwy, Dallas, TX 75228",Dallas,"Went in to add wife to account twice.  First time told to wait and after 30 minutes someone comes to tell me no one is available to wait, why tell me to take a seat and make me wait then.  Second time told they will check if banker is available, told to take a seat and wait.  Finally they called me up and asked if I was there to open an account and again repeated “adding another person to my account”, then get told that personal banker needs to do that and that she is helping someone already and need to make an appointment. That is ridiculous!  This means I have to go for a 3rd time and pray the banker will be available with an appointment.  What happened to the days where you walk in and wait your turn and get helped?  Guess after 20+ years with Chase it’s time to look for another bank.Very rud personal to tell me than they can't attent us. After 30 min waiting for two different  people.On 10/21/21 I was in need of a notary and this branch NEVER answer the phone I call the 800# and was inform I need to make a appointment with this branch to answer such a simple question because they NEVER ANSWER THE PHONE.
Ha🤣
The next day a representative from this branch call back to late UPS... ""YES"" the Brown Truck have employee on staff to give you the service that your Financial institute failed at. What a disappointment.Went on Saturday to open a joint account. The agent told me was not available that day and that I had to open the account online. Went on line and opened the account and the website told me to go to the agency. Went again to the agency and other agent told me to make an appointment to see me and did not attend my request.

280,Chase Bank,"4435 S Lancaster Rd, Dallas, TX 75216",Dallas,"The security guard here needs conflict resolution skills. He wears a deputy sheriff shirt but is working private security. The only thing he did is flirt and be disrespectful to everyone else.  The ATMs are always broken, and your hours are sporadic. This is setting people up for conflict, and the igniter is your armed security. Southern Dallas deserves better!!! The regional and local operations manager should be fired.This branch is everything a full service bank shouldn’t be. When I walked in the “banker” was busy looking on her cell phone and there wasn’t a teller in sight. As customers waited in line, one finally came out of the back and acted bothered that she actually had customers. After waiting over 10 minutes for the person in front of me to finish their transaction I was finally allowed to go to the window. After asking for my debit card and ID and telling her that I needed to do an electronic transfer she looked at the information that I gave her, rolled her eyes and said she couldn’t do that. I had to go online or do it with a banker, but she was too busy. One her personal phone watching TikTok videos no doubt. I was reminded why I took most of my business from Chase Not only is trying to bank through their archaic online site frustrating and impossible, no one at the branches seems to have any interest in actually helping customers. I am done and have moved to a great national financial service that greets you when you walk in the door and always are eager to help with any task. So yes, Chase  it’s not me it’s youAs always they are very courteous and well take care of needs to your satisfaction and to have a good conversation with. Very nice people and I enjoy my visit every timeThis location ATM never works properly. Then they charge for going to another bank. Just ridiculousATM SEEMS TO BE DOWN MOST OF THE TIME. Like right now. CHASE COULD YALL FIX THIS OR ADD ANOTHER ATM IN DRIVE THRU THAT WORKS. It’s an inconvenience to your customers. Especially since gas prices are on the rise. I gotta drive around the city to find a working ATM. Costing me more money.Tried to get assistance opening an acct for my youngest. No customer waiting, staff mentioned no banker they close at 2 and I got here at 1 after wasting time at another branchWhat gets me are the hidden fees that they choose not to share with you until it's time by that time you're well into the Chase banking experience I think a little bit more transparency should be practicedUsed drive thru it was good 👍🏾 …Bogus service and front desk and helpers got attitude issuesAssistant manager/ Vice President is very Unprofessional and rude to customersVery helpfulGreat Service","Positives:

I was only there to open a chase total checking account and he went above and beyond, and exceeded any expectations I had. I will continue to go to only this branch of chase for all of my banking needs. Thank you Brandon for helping me in my time of need. I will never forget it.Walked in at closing time on a Saturday and still received the best service by Brandon. He is a total Rockstar. Very knowledgeable, extremely patient and funny too! I'm glad we opened a account at chase..I have been a customer of this branch for years now, and every time I go in there I have a great experience.  I have had the pleasure of working with both Nick and Brandon and I highly encourage all small business owners to work with them both.  my wife and I own a real estate company and have had issues with 3rd parties and/or other branches and Nick/Brandon have always fixed our issues.  Even small things like having notaries available as tellers when the other branch on Greenville rarely even has a notary in the office.Came in today with a nuanced issue in need of assistance. Had the pleasure of working with banker Brandon F, who was both friendly and super helpful. He was able to help me find a  solution and really went the extra mile. It’s more and more rare to receive this level of service anywhere, and I’m duly impressed! Would recommend💯 …Brandon was super awesome- I needed to see a banker in person today, and he was incredibly accommodating, helpful, and knowledgeable.  Because of good work like his, this branch is awesome.I have never been disrespected and insulted by a bank ""professional"" until today.

This man was endearing, kind, courteous, listened to me before he spoke, and treated me with the respect which he got back from me deservingly.  A true blessing to this company.  This man deserves the best pay, the most time off, the best insurance plan, and to be treated with kindness wherever he goes.  Thank you for this wonderful service today!Waited in the branch 40 minutes before anyone talked to us, then told us we had to make an appointment 2 days later. Just trying to add someone to an account and you can't do it anywhere else but a branch.It seems very inefficient inside at the teller windows, and when I went, the check deposit machine was not working. I went outside to try to do drive-through, but that didn’t seem to be working either. Please fix your technology and processesGreat experience, came in for assistance on short notice and Denisse Perez took care of all the questions I had very thankful for the courtesy she showed.This chase locks the doors to their after hours ATMs and only has 1/2 drive through atms availableI was here for thirty min trying to make a business deposit.Closed my account and will never bank with Chase againThis place rocks :)

I had an appointment with Nicolas Moore, a banker at this location, and he was amazing. Super friendly, engaging, hilarious, professional, and kind. What a gem of a human.Thanks to Nicholas Moore this is the Chase to come to hands down. After my husband and I dealt with some unfortunate things with our joint account we came to see Nicholas Moore and he went above and beyond for us and did absolutely everything he could for us, he took the time to get to know us and to try to fix our problem. Out of everyone that we came across during our unfortunate set of events Nicholas was the only one that could give us answers and reassurance. Nicholas Moore is the absolute best and anyone who wants to speak to someone who is attentive, compassionate and just amazing needs to come to this location and speak to him, I only wish we met him sooner!Best customer service ever!

Exceptional, customer service!What bank would not assist you with opening a new account??? its not my fault your low on staff!!! After waiting for a while you tell customers and to top it off your so rude about!!! Take your business  elsewhere !!!!!!This branch might as well be turned into an ATM.  I went to get items notarized to be told by 3 persons that the notary is acting as a teller and unavailable.  Why wouldn't one of those employees take over for a few minutes so the notary could assist?  Kindly informed me that UPS across the street also has a notary.Print your receipt at this one if you do anything with the ATM here! Yesterday deposited money but didn’t get a physical or digital receipt because I never have a problem with the one near me. Woke up today with a notification from my chase app about a overdraft and saw the money I deposited never went into my accountPoor customer service.  Each time I have been to this location to have to do anything other than getting cash out,  was a waste of time.  They are more interested in getting you out of there face as fast as possible if not transaction of funds.This branch has horrible customer service. Very judgmental as well. Trying to withdrawal from my account  but they denied it and not only that they put a block on my account.Your bank teller stole $5 from mu change order.

They prioritize having three people greet you with smiles and ask what you need help with but only have maybe one or zero people to actually help you with whatever you need that day. I see it every time I come in here. It’s a joke.Lines are ridiculously long and they only have 1 or 2 lanes open.  Rude tellers.

286,Chase Bank,"10729 Preston Rd, Dallas, TX 75230",Dallas,"Horrible bank, clueless inefficient staff.  I made an appointment to close my deceased parents' small accounts and obtain a check payable to my Mom's estate.  I brought all the required documentation to the appointment.  First, they told me they'd have to send my certified copy of the letters testamentary to their attorney and that would take a day.   I've made 3 more trips to the bank since and still don't have the check despite there being no issues whatsoever with my documentation.  They NEVER answer their phone.  I'll never do business with Chase based on my experience with this bureaucratic mess.Borrowed more than $100,000 from this large bank. Loan closing was on Friday, 4/23/21. I did not receive the loan proceeds until 4/29/21. Money deposited at Chase, where I have been a customer for more than 20 years, &  Chase still has a hold on my money until 5/11/21. Worst experience of my life, as Chase is in the money lending business, & they do not value their individual customers. It is time for change in the consumer banking business, in my opinion. Long fintech.Staff is very inexperienced and untrained. They do not answer the phone- ever- have called them from the lobby and they will not pick up phone even if no customers in bank.

287,Chase Bank,"2530 Fort Worth Ave, Dallas, TX 75211",Dallas,"At the time this branch was convenient, so I visited to get my last name changed on my account... Per the website I only needed my legal document that showed my name change and a supporting document.. I had the following documents displaying my new last name:
marriage license, social security card, and a credit card... I had the following documents displaying my old name: current passport, current driver's license, chase debit card, chase credit card, work id, and I was in full uniform with a name plate that displayed my last name... The banker Ben (who stated he's been with Chase for over 20 years) went through the motions with me (over 30 minutes) and stated he couldn't do it... The drop down menu didn't give him the option to choose marriage license or social security card as forms of identification, only social security cards for minors and seniors.. He stated I needed to at least have my new driver's license/id displaying my new name, even the temporary one... I explained to him before we started (when he came to get me from the waiting area, before we sat down) what service I was there for, and the documents I had as proof... I also explained at the beginning I was still awaiting to get my new driver's license, and my appointment was in a couple of weeks.. I was a bit upset, but I just left... I have been a customer with Chase for over 21 years (when they were Washington Mutual), and I have multiple accounts with them, including accounts for my children... Thanks to a banker at the branch on Marsh Ln (Dallas) I was able to get my last name changed on my account within 5 minutes.. I gave the banker all of the same information I had given Ben, but this time I had my temporary driver's license... The banker stated they didn't need all of those documents, but that was fine.. The banker offered other services as well as showed me how to make sure fees were waived on my children's accounts... When the banker was helping me I noticed on the drop down menu that my marriage license and social security card displaying my new last name would have been sufficient enough to have gotten my last name changed on my account when I visited with Ben... Chase can never be on one accord, everything/everyone states something different (from the website, to customer service at the 800 number, to the branch staff)... I wasn't surprised by the incorrect information Ben had given me; but, I won't be visiting the Ft. Worth Ave branch again, whether it's convenient or not..My father who has been banking with Chase over 25 years wrote me a large check. I went in to cash the check and the banker asked if my dad has ever written  me a check. I responded yes, the banker FINDS a history of him writing me a check.
So then because my name was written with what looks like a E in their eyes, they refuse to cash my check.
Then to top it off, they stamped it as if it had been deposited.
The Manager comes out to tell her employee to leave it alone and not correct the fact that it was not deposited!
No wonder this Chase has so many low reviews. It’s clearly run by idiots - specially the Manager and Banker that clearly saw a history of many checks written to me by my father. TrashWaited for fifteen minutes just for them to tell me they don’t have a banker, even though I let them know I needed a banker when I walked in. Also the teller is doing crochet instead of helping customers????Just goes to show it doesn't matter what you with the customer service sucks. The atms outside dont always work but yet the green lights stay on green. If the staff inside see a huge ridiculous line outside then they should go out there and see whats the problem. But I guess they don't get paid enough to do that.The absolute worst experience ever!! From mailing out a debit card, trying to get a pin, withdrawals, deposits, even going into the branch for in person help, because God forbid you try calling this branch. Nothing has been smooth or easy about this bank.This is the worst CHASE BANK i have ever walked into . My husband and I walked into and ask to speak with the branch manager . A guy by the name BEN who works there told us that he would not help us because my husband who is hard of hearing talks too loud and that offered BEN . He REFUSED to help us. He threw his arms up in the air and said I will not help you sir because you talk too loudly . I told him that my husband was hard of hearing and BEN dud not want to hear it . So I told my husband let’s go and we left . We went yo the Chase Bank on Slyvan Ave and the Bank Manger there treated us with kindness and respect. His name is James Tarr . James Tarr helped us with the problem we were having and got it taken care of immediately. Thank You Mr. James Tarr we need more Bank Mangers like you sir. Thank You for your hard work and wonderful customer service.Forgot my ID needed money on my break had my account number cancelled card since they cancel the other one for unknown transaction. Said they could ask me questions to withdraw the money but that they needed a Manager still to approve the transaction and a Manager wasn't working at the moment. So they couldn't give me money out of my money account.The worst Chase location by far. Won't be returning.NEVER COME HERE!!! I tried to deposit my money and the atm rebooted in the middle of it. I called the bank and they didn’t help me AT ALL. I couldn’t even get my cash back. This wasn’t some petty amount of cash, it was my ENTIRE paycheck. The people on the phone aren’t much help either. Just stay away!!!

24 hour update:
This branch has stolen $2490 of my money and refuses to return it.

3 day update:
I received a credit for my money after jumping through hoops like some circus animal. Though it got resolved, some of my bills were late being paid and would’ve been on time, had someone done their freaking job.I was told one thing to make me wait, and then when they hoped that having waited so long I'd be less inclined to balk, they changed their offer.  When the time came to sign agreements, ben the manager proved changeable.
I went down and across the street to a different bank, where I was treated much more better.
:)Staff is great very friendly and helpful.  I went in, to cash a check and was informed by a young lady that there may be a fee.  I inquired about opening an account the staff was extremely busy but they were able to help me with everything within a timely manner.  I dunno how others are complaining, if you re not happy with this bank close your accounts and go somewhere else like the ""David Downer"" below, nothing but ""Karens"" complaining.Has VERY BAD customer service went to the Bank at 4:59 on a Friday and there was other car that was there before me we both got turn way because the teller said ooo sorry mama we are close I told her if she was joking she said No we are close told her that was not good customer service for her as a tell that represents her bank . Told her she should of just tended to us and sent us on a merry way But no she said they close right at 5:00 no matter what … !!! LoL what a joke This bank is they ALWAYS has VERY BAD customer service don’t know why I even bother with them … I wondered if the Manager of the Bank knows how bad they really are to customers of Chase Bank on Forth Worth Ave. in Old Cliff … Must tell the public about this Bad managed Bank … FYI🥺Jasmine was more then helpful ! Very understanding and transparentoutside ATMs are ALWAYS out of service.
Literally ALWAYS.
They have 3 and 100% of the time, they are not all functional. So there’s always a long line.

If you’ve been to this Chase, or live in the area, you know EXACTLY what I’m talking about.HORRIBLE SERVICE!!! If I could give zero stars, I would! The Spanish assistant seems to serve other Spanish speaking clienta with more respect, and patience... especially if they are Spanish Men. Why Do They Also Have 8 different cubicles for Bankers, but only have 1 Banker working... and he barely speaks English 🤷🏻‍♀️? She didn't know I was bilingual, and all she does is run people off to appointments, or first come 1st serve on Sat. When she knows damn well... they are open from 9-2 and the parking lot is packed by 8am with people waiting. Went to Sylvan spot instead. Pathetic!!!Cristy was very helpful and was able to answer all of my questions. Very friendly customer service. Will be back to open an account. I've had a bad experience at a previous branch and she changed my mind.Once again you can never use the atms because they never work doors close at 5pm. What about the working person. Just close down the location already.They have three ATMs and almost always either all of them are down or two of them are down what is the point of conveniency and having three ATMs that don’t always workthe attention is lousy and the ATMs do not work properly they are always out of service.Easy in and out service at the drive through lanes, the employees are very nice and very helpful.By the time you obtain your withdrawn money your whole life practically flashes on by. The people there honestly don't take their work seriously.GoodQuick friendly 🥰🥰 …","Positives:

Woefully understaffed and the staff that is here isn't flexible to adjust based on lines and demand and demonstrating need for better management.Horrible customer service. They never answer the phone. They make you feel like you are doing something wrong instead of guiding you.My wife and I are long-time chase customers. We like the bank, but this particular location is terrible. My wife scheduled an appointment to change her name on the account, but the guy was ""out to lunch"" during the scheduled appointment time, made her wait 30 minutes, and then immediately turned her away- saying she didn't have the right documents (she had the documents listed on the website). They were rude and unhelpful, and I advise any chase customer to avoid this location.My boyfriend and I were so happy to pick this chase branch. We had a large situation on our hands that no other branch that we went to took it seriously and made sure we were fully taken care of. Jessica Balbaoa thank you for listening and understanding our situation we’re beyond happy we ran into you thank you for making sure this situation was taken care of. It was an overall very helpful branch!I would rather drive an hour across town than go to this chase bank location. Even if it’s just to stop at the ATM, terrible place. Don’t bother. It’s never worth it. And I live one block from this location.The team here is amazing I have been having troubles that brought .e to tears and the moment I walked in this branch they all jumped right on my problem to get it fixed David was head in and very confident to get the job done even though I don't bank with chase anymore I loved the service here and made me want to come back not all banks and bank tellers are the professional and willing to help as they whereTheir reviews are terrible because their service is terrible. Good luck getting anyone to answer the phone. So basic yet so incompetent.Worst banks ever . Banks are closed and people at the banks are not helpful and not willing to help. Lady was rude at the window.  I drove around to seven chase banks 0 stars.Worst location.Good customer serviceExcellent client serviceExcellent service...","Positives:

Everyone will hear what’s going on with your account.

Been with Chase for over 10 years and shut down my account today due to the way they treated me at THIS SPECIFIC location.One of the worst chase bank locations unprofessional I was waited almost 1 hours and did nothing.just liedNot much to say besides they don’t care about their customers concerns and just brush you off .

291,Chase Bank,"15202 Montfort Dr, Dallas, TX 75248",Dallas,"Drove up to drive though today PATTY assisted me (NOT REALLY) I told her what I NEEDED done and she did the complete opposite. I mentioned I needed to cash my check then deposit to AVOID having to WAIT TILL TOMORROW for my funds PATTY tells me yes we can do this then comes and tells me ok $200 is your available balance NOW and the REST of the funds WILL BE AVAILABLE TOMORROW… THAT IS NOT WHAT I ASKED FOR. I repeated to her what I needed her to do as previously told in the beginning  PATTY proceeded to say because the check was from a different bank and not chase she couldn’t do it (HAD SHE TOLD ME BEFORE I WOULD’NT of done it this way as i always deposit with the app and at least $500 go through immediately) BUT PATTY FAILED TO INFORM ME THAT SHE COULD’NT DO WHAT I ASKED HER TO. (Im upset because this was an EMERGENCY and instead of her doing her job correctly and telling me SHE COULD’NT DO WHAT I ASKED HER TO and LEAVING IT UP TO ME TO DECIDE IF I WANTED TO PROCEED WITH DEPOSITING OR NOT SHE TOOK IT UPON HERSELF TO DEPOSIT IT. NOW NOT ONLY DO I HAVE LESS FUNDS AVAILABLE BUT ILL ALSO BE HAVING TO WAIT TILL TOMORROW.. (Had I not been on my lunch break I would’ve gotten down to file a formal complaint on PATTY for NOT DOING HER JOB correctly and I would still like to file a complaint to avoid PATTY from making more mistakes in the future.Walked in at noon today to start an account with Chase Bank and I must say, I was very impressed with the person I spoke too. I was really nervous about making a new bank account because at previous banks, they threw all kinds of terms at me that I didn't understand. Not here. Javier explained everything so well and responded to every question I had with the utmost patience. He was kind, considerate, and made me feel like I had control over my finances again. He even gave me his business card so that I can continue working with him and I most certainly will. Thanks to him, Chase Bank is about to get free advertising to anyone I know that's looking for a new bank.If you enjoy driving to the atm only to find out... it's not working... Then this is definitely the location for you!!! Every other day this atm is down. Legit frustrating and inconvenient.I have been using this office for many years. Then recently I found the tellers are just lack of knowledge and even providing the wrong information. Do not use this branch office of Chase.Carlos is amazing he helped fix the situation. I very much appreciated how he did everything in his power to get my  check back to me.The after hours card access doesn’t work. The outside atm rarely works. 👎 …Worst customer service ever.  None of the people here understand their service. I haven't had a worse customer experience anywhere in years. Terrible.Customer service not good at all ,employees are always in phone they don’t care customers,if you ask some questions they don’t have answers I don’t recommend this branchWe have Luis Rondon as our Business banker he is so good at responding to us. Thanks. Luis.The teller was very friendly. She also quoted me a realistic wait time.Neyri is always so nice and helpful! This location is convenient and fast.Drive Thru ATM is always broken and business hours listed are inaccurate.Very friendly bank staff! Clean, convenient!👍👍👍 …Good Customer Service.","Positives:

292,Chase Bank,"13398 Preston Rd, Dallas, TX 75240",Dallas,"I went to chase bank on Preston last week to make a cash deposit. There’s no ones when I get there at the window .Waiting about to 3 to 5 minutes to get my receipt for the deposit a white lady who was helping me  and I’m thinking she is the manager told me to get off the line because there’s a problem with the printer stated that And She will bring me the receipt outside
Waiting outside for 3 minutes she never came  outside for my receipt. I went out there to see if my deposit was made . I asked her and she told  me that another employee is working  on it while she was helping other customers making deposit  Which Was a big lie after I insisted that I can’t wait no  longer I leaving for work   I need my money because you refused to help me with the deposit. Very unprofessional and angry she went out to get the money out of the drawer and gave it to me with my Ids.  She was very unprofessional and with a bad attitude I told her I was coming to this branch for over 6 years but never experience this in my life  I will never return to that branch
IOne of the worst chase bank branch. I have recently booked my appointment and when I have visited the branch, there was no banker who I have appointment with. They have asked to reschedule to visit again and have wasted my time. It’s not worth visiting this bank. Thanks.The bank branch is closed down without even letting customers know about it.

296,Chase Bank,"9409 Garland Rd, Dallas, TX 75218",Dallas,"Absolutely ridiculous experience and waste of time.
Opened a new business checking and savings account on 9/11/23. Deposited 6.7k in person that same day.
Deposited 11.8k the next day in person.
Today, 9/14, the account is apparently being restricted so no one, including me, can access the funds and I’m being told the account will likely be shut down. My money? Tied up until chase says so apparently. Projects, bills, everything held up because of this. The banker that helped, Sylvia, has not responded to emails or phone calls.

BANK SOMEWHERE ELSE. FOREGO CHASE ALTOGETHER IF YOU CAN HELP IT.Wonderful banker, Iris, helped me to learn how to look for and read items in my banking history after a friend dissuaded me from falling for an internet scam. Got the new account after closing the old one. Great example of a well trained, personable lady who likes her job, radiating it as customers are helped by her.👍😀 …I felt discriminated against for being an immigrant. The lady refused to open an account using my passport, visa and SSN. I immediately drove to another bank and they opened the account as all my documents are valid and my status in the country is completely legal. I felt very humiliated and will never return to this bank.In person service at Chase is amazing, but it's 2022 and most people use online banking. That said, dealing with Chase over the phone or online is about as bad as it gets. Call transfer after transfer, no one is ever able to provide info or any help, and they WILL make it seem like you the customer did something wrong. Don't recommend.This bank branch..employees are going good and friendly staff ""BUT"" it's the more poorly bank branch..never has plastic ,bag boxes chase envelopes..pens always....they need more supplies or the don't have money ???
That's why I'm gonna drive more far to the next branch ..they are way better that this branch..Theres always errors on the two atmQuick and easy, Monica was great. Thank you for helping me out!It is a very bad service 😡 to the customer they are not kind at all I had an appointment and after 35 minutes of waiting to be attended to they told me that they could not attend me because I was 9 minutes late 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡","Positives:
- Wonderful banker, Iris, who provided excellent assistance and helped the customer with their banking history.
- In-person service at Chase is described as amazing.

297,Chase Bank,"11770 Marsh Ln, Dallas, TX 75229",Dallas,"Today, I felt extremely uncomfortable. My wife & I along with my mother in law wanted to adjust our joint account. When we arrived, the security guard made us feel very uncomfortable. Starring among us as if we were criminals as well as the tellers behind the window. (Mind you), I’m Black. Not implying the bank has an prejudice environment, it certainly felt this way. Almost immediately upon arrival (after having to explain myself to a teller who seemed incompetent on the topic). They told us the systems were completely down, which is weird because two bankers were in mid process helping two other customers. This bank is beyond unprofessional, with always an excuse when I arrive. This is the 4h time I’ve arrived with a team of uncompensated behavior & an vibe of uncomfortable behavior.Horrible customer service. I went in to schedule an appointment with a banker to set up a new chase account. I go in to the bank at the time I’m scheduled and I’m told that my appointment was moved to a later time since the banker had to go somewhere I leave and come back at the new scheduled time and he still isn’t there. I told the man at the front that I had an appointment and he said well he isn’t here I’m sure you were given a call and if you didn’t answer your phone that is your own problem. A lady (Lorena) then comes out and says I’ll help you not only was she sick and coughing everywhere she is rude and in a rush.Ridiculous wait time! No one works here. It's a ghost town.
11 offices/cubicles, 3 bankers, 1 teller.
I've been waiting so long I could've written a book, done my taxes, started my own darn bank!My visit was on April 4th, 2022 9am at the branch in Dallas Marsh/Forest Ln. I’ve been depositing my business money there for the last few months and everyone there is really nice but the visit for Monday the 4th is a different story. Mr Sanchez was extremely rude because I wouldn’t write my name on a deposit slip even though he had my card and driver’s license. I’m not the one that complains but I feel this was totally uncalled for. Usually the guy that takes care of me is always nice and friendly, I think he wasn’t there that day. I would like a follow up regarding this issue.I was standing in line, but the front desk staff passed me up by two other people; asking if they needed help instead of me, quite annoyed!This is the worst Chase bank location! ATMs are always malfunctioning or down and the customer service here is disgraceful.Worst branch ever. Only one teller working whenever I walk in.I’m very displeased with this location, we have made several appointments and every time I arrive I receive an excuse if why my appointment was moved or why the appointment of the banker is not there . It’s unacceptable and very unprofessional. And this is the only location we have this issue with . We are not sending our staff back . Neither will I go back to this location. And corporate will definitely receive a letter about this matter .If you're going to start a business acct make sure you have a LLC or a registered business acct before you go. Even after repeatedly telling them I only have an EIN, and no LLC, they kept on saying I only need a form of ID. It was such a waste of time todayI had an appointment with a banker at 11:30am. Came 11:22am, waited until 11:59am. Had to leave. Thinking moving my main business to another bank.Atms Never WorkI love this place!! Staff is always very friendly and ready to help!!!
My go to Branch!!!Atms out of orderAlways friendly and fast serviceDefinitely an excellent branch to carry out your banking procedures, the service is very good and they explain and help you resolve your doubts, Mrs. Sandra Arredondo, is without a doubt a professional and very friendly, I highly recommend this branch and this bankI have another account at well fargo but for me this bank is the best of all and I have been with them for more than 2 years and I am very happy I will always continue with chaseThey should fix their ATMs that haven't been working for about two months.","Positives:

299,Chase Bank,"4615 Frankford Rd, Dallas, TX 75287",Dallas,"Came for a notarized the employee  first said the notarized person is not here today then said they are the bankers too  helping another customer and take an appointment for another day at 2 pmThis is the 3rd of 4th time I've been to the this branch and had the lobby closed during normal business hours.  No explanation.  Today was just a note on the glass door saying lobby was closed except for scheduled appointments....so the lobby WASNT closed, just to those who didn't make an appointment.
I've been a chase account holder with multiple accounts including my business accounts for years..., but after today I'm considering moving my accounts to another bank.  The manager needs some serious classroom instruction on how to operate their branch.  2 Stars...only because Im feeling generous...maybe a 1 star.Apparently theres a Chase closer to me so I'll go to that one from now on. I typically drop off deposits for my company. This morning I did a deposit and needed change for a Hundred dollar bill. I wrote 50 1 dollar Bill's and 10 5 dollar Bills. Simple. I get back to my job and end up with a 50 dollar bill and 5 ten dollar Bills. If the girl was confused she could've asked. Why would I break a hundred and want a 50 dollar friggin bill? The girl with black hair who thinks shes cute doesn't have common sense. I'll go to the other Chase next time.Not much of a bank, was told they only had $25 in coins in the entire bank SMH....I like this location, you go in and it's clear where to go. The tellers and waiting line are right there and take up most of the space. Other Chase locations have a weird empty lobby with a bunch of cubicles and the tellers are squirreled away in the back somewhere. There were 3 tellers working morning on a Wednesday, just one person in line before me, the girl I got was super nice and fastCalled to get this branch's routing number and the rude teller told me ""we don't give that information out over the phone. You should know better"" and hung up on me. Wish there was a way to give 0 stars.Very inconvenient I haven't been able to log On for months it might work once per week.
It is 310 on a Wednesday and the location is closed for no apparent reason..
Try Wells Fargo.I came in to Chase to fix an issue I had 3 years ago and keep in mind I was sleep deprived from working at night shift. Yitong W was kind of enough to help me through the process of opening my account again and helped me choose my options.Received quick and friendly service at this branch. There were plenty of staff servicing customers for a variety of requestsChristopher was very helpful.  Do yourself a solid and make sure you have an appointment.Literally asked to make an account and they told us it would take and hour and to make an appointment when it wasn’t even busyRude employees will never go back there again","Positives:
- Clear layout and organization inside the branch

300,Chase Bank,"16831 Coit Rd, Dallas, TX 75248",Dallas,"I’m a long time chase customer but this branch can get betterNo system to check-in walk ins or new customers. Had to wait for an hour before somebody showed up to me.Not terrible but their ATM has eaten my cash during deposits on several occasions which I had to make a claims to have returned. Also their exchange rate for foreign currency is a joke, might as well do it at the airport. If GBP is $1.13 why charge $1.30???Why can't they hire more people? too much wait time. I see lot of empty rooms. Just two staffs trying to run around. Why to open too many offices while no one is there to work for??

However someone did help me and am happy with his assistance.This place stinks. They close at 2:00 and the ATMs don’t even work.  Haha- don’t even waste your timeI am a student and everything went well after taking an appointment smoothly. Love their service.Routine transaction, not busy, no wait time.This comment is not directed at  the branch but at corporate, what your money closely.  They're stealing from there customersAtm is always broken.

301,Chase Bank,"18320 Preston Rd, Dallas, TX 75252",Dallas,"I cannot speak highly enough of my experience with Chase Bank. As a customer for several years, I have found Chase Bank to be an exceptional financial institution that consistently delivers outstanding service.

The online and mobile banking platforms are intuitive and user-friendly, allowing me to manage my finances with ease.

Wanted to open a new checking account but no thanks. I’d rather go to Wells Fargo where they appreciate new business.Just went there today around 4:15  VP David G. assisted us and refused to notarize by son’s document.  He said bec my son does not have an account with Chase.  My son has a debit card on his name but still under me.  He refused.  My son is on the spectrum.  He can’t have his own account bec of his disorder.  This VP of this bank refused to serve my special kid.  I have been with chase 10 years and this is the first time a staff refused to serve me and my family.  Worst customer service.One ATM machine and it’s broke almost every month. Put one in the lobby genius and replace the one outside in the drive thru.

302,Chase Bank,"4236 Wycliff Ave, Dallas, TX 75219",Dallas,"Had a substantial credit on my Chase credit card. It took them three times (i.e. myself coming in three different occasions) in order to tell me the solution was to call the number on the back of my card and that they couldn't handle credits or cash advances here. This is why I use Bank Of America, it would have been solved in 2 minutes.

Don't use this bank, they are idiots.I just spoke with a business banker at Oaklawn Wycliff at Dallas branch. I called regarding my business and personal account. I have never encountered a banker this Unwilling to help. Repeatedly as if he was harassing me not wanting to help. Requested for the managers name. He just said manager is off today and declined to give the name of the branch in charge. I was denied an appointment with the manager. My previous banker who was amazing left the organization . It’s pathetic to know this is how bankers treat public these days.I was talked abusively today by Nathaniel Edwards.  I only needed to close an account and now I have to go elsewhere because I do not appreciate being mansplained by some white abuser in a suit.  If you are anything but white or cis or straight please avoid this branch.  You don’t need to experiment this trauma.  I’ll have to see my therapist about this one unfortunately…. Not a safe place.Waiter over an hour for someone to help me with fraudulent checks being stolen on our business account. Still waiting and leaving to go to the branch in West Village.

303,Chase Bank,"1881 Sylvan Ave, Dallas, TX 75208",Dallas,"As a new business, I decided to give Chase a chance to be my banking provider, but after only 4-6 weeks they managed to already demonstrate that they are not willing or able to conduct business professionally.
1. They are not very clear or communicative if an issue has developed, so you will have to drive all communication with them.
2. They are very limited on business bankers at the location, so you will have to make an appointment for everything.
3. They will close your accounts and not tell you anything, no notice of closure or what they did with your funds.

Thanks to these facts, they can mess up the one thing that should work flawlessly for new business, and that's getting paid for your hard work. When your clients have to call you and tell you "" hey, I want to pay you, but your bank account came back as no good?"" It helps you look really good! 🤨Catherine Douglas Diaz was super helpful and has been patient to understand our needs and explaining the things in detail for opening the account as needed.

Worth Ave location Mr. Ben refused to help us because my husband was hard of hearing 😡The chase Bank on Illinois street near Coombs creek lol I was in total shock at their ignorance of our bank needs . Had no clue what we were needing assistance with on our two bank accounts.

That’s the way it should have been when we walked into the first Chase Bank !This bank is so severely understaffed it shouldn’t be open. Huge queue on the inside to see 2 tellers.

She made sure to get me information and different options 😊 much appreciated! …ATM's do not function. Chase leaves the green arrow on.  You  are completely unaware that you and the others behind you in the line are not going to receive service. No one answers the phone number provided.  When you call the local branch to call is routed to the national company and no one answers.  i went to another Chase bank down the road.

I am a member of Chase Bank & have been for a long time. I live closer to another branch but have had problems at that branch as well so I started coming to this branch even though it's a little further of a drive for me. Anyway I walked into the bank today & specifically asked to talk with a banker about my situation just to be told it would be a while before someone could help me & I could wait in the long line for a cashier to help me out. Does knowone know how to listen to a customer anymore ? I am getting to the point where I am thinking I should take my money elsewhere.Ordered a replacement card almost 2 weeks ago and for some reason they keep telling me that “it should arrive the next day” but it never arrives I called and I went in person and they have no idea how I haven’t received my card yet1 star because I can’t give 0, we had an appointment at 3pm on Monday and they said that the person who we had the appointment was not available so they rescheduled for Tuesday at 11:30am and it was already 12:15 and we were still waiting
They ended up apologizing and rescheduling again, like we have all the time in the world.After a long wait in the line found out that I can’t get notary done because the banker forgot to bring his notary stamp pad.Rude and unprofessional employees, most of the employees doing nothing but one of them telling me all of our employees busy booked appointments and can’t help to open an account for nowWhy when I call, I get a straight robot?

In conclusion, we could not make the account because we were missing the Cuban passport. It was a bad experience in this place. We will go to another bank that is better.They tell you to make an appointment for any questions or changes to your account. They make an appointment for you at that time, you arrive and you still have to wait as a walk-in customer because they feel like it.

You take to long to answer the phone tho I hardly see anyone there, and I'm guessing something is wrong with your chase app since recently when I deposit my check y'all only give me half of my money, this is the second time this has happened and I don't even make a lot for y'all to be giving me half of my money and the other half the next day. The only thing I can say was good was my banker, he was very nice and helpfulToday I walked into Chase Bank and was just standing there, no acknowledgement or anything. Bank tellers are just chatting away and then when I finally said something they had the nerve to have an attitude  about ignoring me and my needs.  And then when people came in after me they got greeted immediately.  This branch is definitely racist and lacks any kind of professional Customer service. There ATM didn't even work. I hope they get shutdown for being a prejudice bank.Very poor service.  Mark Blair the Branch Manager is very rude. I told them to forward all bank correspondence to my PO Box. After four months they still do not send my bank mail to the right address. I have notify them several time without any change.

Luis Garcia AVP is never there and does not address the phone or emails. The bank has been robed several times.

Do yourself a favor and avoid this place...........................Their ATM debited $200 off of my card and it didn’t disperse the money. So, they stole $200 and were zero help on the phone.

Big shout out to Mrs. Carmen (banker) who assisted me this morning. Though I went in for notary assistance, I was helped by opening a new checking account and savings accounts. I'm a tax preparer and help people with their taxes. Mrs. Carmen provided me with the service I like to give to my clients.  She took the time to educate me on new accounts, saving accounts and minor accounts. She will make sure all your questions are answered. I felt confident and cared for.

Great Service!This bank never ever has both atm machines working or the one inside has no access too, the line after 5 is always all around the building it’s horrible waste of time just drive the extra time to Cartwright locationService is awful
Atms never work outside plus you can never go inside after house to use the one inside the outside door.It's either Balch Springs Chase Bank or Lake June Chase Bank. Both never faill to fulfill my need. Thank you guys!They never answer the phone, the drive thru always closed.I went to this bank and I asked for a temporary card since my original card got lost they informed me that they don’t do temporary cards anymore but than the system says they are available what type of information are they giving.Worse bank ever. Their ATM's are trash.The staff there was very helpful and polite.It should be zero stars. I arrived here today with 5 minutes left at 2:00 and a man from the bank no longer let me in. Because? If your schedule says they close at 2:00 pm. Then modify your schedule and say that you close whenever you want. I understand that at 2:00 pm they should no longer let customers in.

I have NEVER been notified of a fraud alert. I called customer service...to no avail. Customer service does not know what the problem is!! My branch in Dallas has closed and I have tried to make appts with other branches but the scheduling systems are down at other locations.  So frustrating holding a CD at 0.01 interest and cannot close  and transfer out of this CD!!!I can’t believe that whenever you visit this bank they have more associates sitting around and the tellers are always swamped. No matter what day it is! Please don’t come on a Saturday you will be waiting up to 30 minutes or more. Bank of America we as customers deserve better especially since it’s our money in our accounts. FIX THIS!!Bank Manager Walter helped us extremely quickly and was a very pleasant transaction! Thanks so much!!

Similar experience with Marianna on 01/25. Excellent service!!Unfortunately, Bank of America has once again caused much frustration.  I visited this branch on a Saturday to exchange foreign currency and was informed that they do not have anyone trained nor with the appropriate access to perform that type of transaction. I was asked to come back Monday.  Needless to say, I will not be returning Monday.  Makes me question if I’m banking with the right company for such a simple transaction done elsewhere.Was called from this location saying someone was trying to make a Zelle transfer, gave me a number to call to report it, it turn out the number I was given was a scam to try to get money out of my account. When I tried to reach the bank again I couldn’t get a hold of them. Never answers the phoneThis branch deserves a zero star rating. I am writing this review while I am waiting in line for almost 1 hour to get the funds deposited to my account. They have only 1 teller and she tends to disappear every now and then. The other two personal bankers don’t care about the customers. One of the banker is hiding in the back room and another one is just chilling in her cubicle.

One word -  HORRIBLE experienceBulldoze this location and design it better.   Add more ATMs and maintain the ones you do have. I can’t believe I’m wasting my time writing a review of a bank, but my experiences here make me want to spend even more time switching my accounts to another bank.Called to verify what was needed to open a child’s joint account. Brought the required documentation to my “appointment”. Waited and was told that birth certificate was not sufficient and a social security was also required before being told another branch could help me. They seemed completely disinterested in taking money or doing any work.Waste of time if you get a account set up by Emmanuel make sure everything is right before you leave  now they closing my account on a mistake that he did after having me wait for 2 hours he still end up messing up my business accountThey have no drive thru.
There was no teller available for 3-4 minutes.

310,Bank of America,"Parking lot, 4023 Cedar Springs Rd, Dallas, TX 75219",Dallas,"Always a long wait...5 to 6 employees wandering around..asking if you need to make a deposit or withdraw and offer zero solutions to line .  There is almost ALWAYS 1 teller, 2 chatting other emcees by desk near front, 2 others sitting at desks by themselves....if line is 10 deep..is no one else available or able to count money.  I detest going here but it's close to work and my business accounts are here..not sure for how much longer tbh..I would have given this experience 5 starts but the black gentleman working behind the desk was very rude. It was VERY clear he did not want to be working and had no interest in helping me. Thankfully there was a lady willing to instruct him on how to help get check details. If not I’m sure that man would have been happy saying “the checks have already been sent out” and left it at that.

Skip to the end he prints off a copy of my check and just hands it to me. No thank you have a good day or nothing. Instead I thanked him and wished him a good day just for him to not even look at me or bother to respond.

This experience was very uncomfortable and unnecessary I hope the next time he shows up to work he leaves his personal baggage at the door and comes in with a better attitude. You work in customer service as do I. Do better.If I could give zero stars I would. What a terrible bank that has no desire for any customer service at all. They will not preform basic bank duties unless you have an appointment, good luck with that if you work or have a life. They are rude, unhelpful. Honestly start an account with any other bank except BofA.Sign on door says closes at 6pm on fridays. I came a 5 sharp. They won’t let me. I’m changing banks.The day before I have to go to send a wire , I tired to call this branch many time no one picked up ,, so I had to leave my work and go , when I arrived I asked the front desk to send the wire Bc it’s my last day to send it , they said there is someone before me , I asked them it’s my break time I can’t come back during my work if you can ask the man who is waiting to give me his turn for my critical situation, they even refused to ask him if he can help me though!!
I told them if you answer the phone I will not drive to you without an appointment!!
Of course I know these kind of employees since I got there and I was Right .. not helpful and not professional employees with a customer.Miss informed that my check was going to be available the next day only to find out through the app that it was going to be available in 8 business days! I have my rent and other bills to pay! I was better off cashing it out at a check cashing place.Long line with 2 tellers. AND 4 other employees not being tellers; asking if they can help with one standing at the door limiting the number of people in the building.I am currently closing on a mortgage with BOA everything was going well until today.  The banker I was working with is out and in her place is Shivani Nandaivada who was unable to communicate to me why my closing date is being pushed back. Shivani very rudely proceeded to tell me I was missing a document the week of closing like I was suppose to know I was missing a document. She also would not listen to concerns or questions regarding the closing told me she wasn’t “arguing” with me. Not even an hour later called me back to address the closing date was being moved, in other words to tell me what I was trying tell her and have addressed earlier. Not only do they not communicate clearly but also don’t listen to customers. Seems like the poor customer service people are complaining about in reviews the carries over to the mortgage department.Line of more than five people and only one teller. Four other employees standing near the door completely ignoring customers talking about what to get for lunch and where. Unbelievable.Unbelievable how the service here gets worst everyday.
Why would a customer wait in line for 30 minutes while all of your employees standing or setting doing nothing.
I know each one has different job or duties but still you are responsible to help customers faster.I’ve been with this bank since 2019 and you would think that if you deposit the same type of check it would be no holds,I’m a business owner so the amounts of my checks are different weekly..this past week I deposited a check into my personal,the same type of check which is “Comdata”..they call and authorize these types of checks before they deposit it into either account ..and these people still hold it for 8 days..soon as it hit my account I’m closing all my accounts.. this bank will put you in a bad predicament..stay away.This bank could partner with the community, but chooses instead to contract to have the community's cars towed. Not sure why anyone would still use BoA.This bank never opens on time- they move slow. They never have resources available. 5 of us are in line and there’s like 8 employees and only one teller1 teller, 3 people to greet you and watch you stand in line for 45min+. Terrible.With a line of people and only one teller at the window, why are three employees standing around talking about tacos????The person who helps people open up a bank account was walking around with his hands in his pockets doing absolutely nothing but was too busy to help my mom open a accountLong line only 1 teller and they make most of the line sit out in the cold.This place has three ATMs. One of them works.Very unprofessional and unknowable staff!","Positives:

- Long wait times
- Lack of available employees to assist customers

311,Bank of America,"7515 Greenville Ave, Dallas, TX 75231",Dallas,"Came in today (Saturday)to get a quick cashiers check.  Saron (spelling probably wrong) who was working the lobby did an excellent job.  Was fast, courteous, and friendly.  Bank was big, clean and had security as well as a few tellers in addition to the gentleman who assisted me.  Very good experience.  Well done BoA.I went to Bank of America on 2-14-2023 at 6750 Greenville ave , I went to cash my check and I asked the teller could I use there restroom and where was it located and he told me where it was I finished up with him and went towards the direction he sent me I didn’t see it so I asked  the lady who was a greeter name (Griselle ) where the restroom was located she said quote “IT IS OUT OF ORDER” I said out of order so I went  back to the teller and I said I thought you said that the restroom was available and he said “it is available. We have one that did not work and we have one that does work so I went back over to the greeter Griselle , and I ask her her name she told me and I said, I thought you said the restrooms was out of order and she didn’t  say anything. She just stood there like a deer in headlights.  I called and made a complaint  because I feel like I was discriminated against because I am a black Woman to make matters worse I’m on medication that causes me to have to go to the restroom frequently, and I do believe that it was discrimination  at that particular branch, and I will not be opening up a bank account  with Bank of America until they change their racist views and  policies, and that other cultures are more respected.Very disappointed with the customer service.
The Financial Center Manager Herman needs to be more understanding. I stoped to show the Identification for the account that I opened online for my son, just like the email states and but he kept insisting that I needed to schedule an appointment. I even called the customer service number to verify I didn’t needed an appointment. The email doesn’t states nothing about scheduling an appointment. Right before me there was a gentleman that had questions regarding Zelle without appointment and he was able to help him but he didn’t wanted to see us??? I didn’t mind waiting at all but he was very rude that kept saying that we needed an appointment. BOfA has been disappointing lately and they don’t care about the customer service at allSadden how Bank of America continues to fail in every way possible. The customer service continues to drop, and the Tellers and Lobby Leaders continue to be rude. Every center I have stepped into this continues to happen.

Anyone reading this switch to Chase Bank, trust me, you will be happier with the customer service, and most of all, you will feel welcomed and appreciated for being a valued client.Banker jeneifer has a negative  attitude when I get to see my scheduled appointments. I have been a customer for BOA over 20 years, today I felt  so unwelcmed by this specific banker and also no one was on the lobby to welcome and show any help. I will be switching to other banks who can serve me better. August 8, @10:00 am.The front desk/doorman, Maurice, was so rude for no reason when I accidentally walked in the wrong door. Like, why? Just kindly tell me where to go. Anyways, I’d recommend going to a different location.Horrible service. There are always several people greeting and 1-2 cashiers on Saturdays.
They need to cross train to have extra help for these cashiers.
Lines are so long and it takes forever to get things done.I have been to this bank multiple times and no tellers were available. Again I went today at 11am and was told to come back in an hour. This is crazy to have to call a bank to know if they have anyone working.Hi)) I’m want to share my impressions of the service in this bank)) I’m just had a problem with the transfer)) I’m was waiting for my turn, an Asian- looking employee approached me))who did not answer my questions, but simply ignored me)) it’s very nice)))Very difficult to do personal business, as staff is severely limited.  Access to some bank services are refused based on arbitrary and obscure excuses.Do you not pay your employes?  The ones here act like you dont and could  care less what, who, or why you even showed up. Bet theyre ready at 5pm to move like the wind.Consistently understaffed. We’re it not a block from my office I would avoid completelyIt take hours to take cash or deposit money poor customer service only one teller and too many customers avoid coming to this branchJust one teller that is shame full they don't care about customersThis the location should closed down. Manager sorry Orlando. Just walking around with the line out the door.They looks like they don't want workThey should just close it, the service is that poorIf I could leave zero stars I would.Friendly and helpful 👌. …Excellent attention.

However, the one lady working was very polite and helpful. They also seem to be able to assist Spanish speaking customers which is nice.I've banked at this location for decades.  The services have become bad in the last few time I visited the branch.  Tellers are still polite, but bank officers either don't care or act blustery, like ""it's good that you have account here,"" and bandying the ""we"" word a lot, like ""we don't do this.""  Part of the culture of being Latino-centric?This Bank location needs support especially on Fridays/beginning of the month. Also, if there was the ATM with virtual assistance here that would help tremendously 🙌🏾 if the decision is to cut staff, ensure there is technology efficient ATMs That can assist with the long lines of customers. There are currently over 20 people in line waiting to be servicedWorthless bankers. Refer you to 888 number to waste time with a machine. Even after being told I had to get off work and drive here because the machine is unable to assist. Inefficient and incompetent branch. Undertrained and understaffed.go elsewhere if you need a competent banker.Terrible hours and long wait times. Make an appointment if you ever want to be seen in a reasonable amount of time.Judy took great care of us with helping us with a wire transfer. We didn’t have an appointment but the staff got us in quickly and were very efficient! Thanks for the wonderful customer service as I know the wait lines can be very long here.First I would like to say there policy say you must make an appointment to open account. Did that a week and half before going for 2:30 👀 my husband and I arrived 15 mins early just case we can get seen sooner. Or maybe someone missed there appointment. We were ask to sit and wait for the person doing our stuff . No problem . We sat down and I look at my watch 2:45 I then ask if we were ever check in because our appointment was at 2:30 they guy says yes and she would be with us shortly . 2:55 still not help.. I then start google the next Bank of America because clearly they didn’t have enough staff  and it was annoying just watching 2 staff members just walking around.. 3pm came and I got up and ask how much longer because our paper said  from 2:30 to 3 . And I had other stuff to do.. finally a different lady came up she said ma’am my appointment didnt show up I can help you . I said okay good because I was about to find another bank.. she helps get the account open because apparently my account was closed and also disable my log in stuff I ask if she could unlock she said no I would have to call the 800 number .  So she gets our account open and going and I have to make a deposit. She couldn’t take the money I had to go stand in line .. 4 people ahead of me and 5 behind me . And one person one! Behind the counter taking payments and cashing checks and doing drive thru🙄 while the other 2 people where still walking around looking like lost goose . So disappointed. Needless to say I didn’t leave the bank till after 4 o clock it was more like 4:20.. I was so annoyed I will never go to that location again..The staff is great and the manager is incredible. Love this bank.Took them almost 14 days to find my $54 that they should’ve put in my account and be available the next day and then I’ve got a huge runaround from the online services, CallCenter and the branch. Bank of America has really gone down.Poor Management. Came on my lunch break to withdrawal funds. It is a Friday at 1pm. There is one teller. Management sent everyone on lunch.Mr. Bryan gave me great customer service.no wonder why they have 1.8 starts recently I tried  to open an account for my teenage daughter Albert kept asking me and my daughter if we were citizens we ended up leaving w/o opening the account he needs better training or just find a suitable job where he can be rude and racistTeller shorted me money and then berated me that it was MY FAULT bc I didn’t open the bundle of ones they give out and count before I left because they DONT COUNT THEM
She was incredibly rude and the manger was standing behind her the whole time letting her be rude to meDon’t waste your time! I wish I was able to give 0 stars! Terrible Terrible customer service! Do not bank of BOA! You will regret it! Save your time, energy, and Money.Huge wait times at the busiest times which are during lunch. Unacceptable don’t waste your time here.The line is always long, and even there are only a few people in front, it always takes a long time .None of the features or tellers are here like the site says. Just like for any of the other branches.Drive thru is closed at all branched nearbyWorst bankI left the place very upset, I have had my business account for many years and I went in asking for help for a deposit of a check, and the only thing I received from a woman who hurts that she did not check her name, were pure negative things, annoyance and really They don't care in the least about my problem, they are not committed people.
It's a shame, I'll avoid going back to that branch, I'm extremely upset.The truth is that it is the worst branch, which unfortunately is the only one close to me.... every time I have come it is a tragedy with tellers, there are only one or two who attend. The manager should be changed... a year after having published my opinion, I still think there is still a lack of a person who responds to clients

314,Bank of America,"10830 Preston Rd, Dallas, TX 75230",Dallas,"BofA continues to get worse.  First, they get rid of the motor bank.  Now, they've closed this branch on Saturdays.  They've done this at other nearby locations, resulting in longer lines at the fewer number of banks that are still open on Saturdays.  Fewer banking locations open on Saturdays, so customers are inconvenienced by having to drive farther away to find an open bank, and then waiting longer because there are never enough tellers.  So much for customer service.This is a great branch. Even when it's busy, they do their best to make sure everyone get's serviced in time. All hands on deck all the time.ConvenientVery happy and satisfied with the service that Christian gave me.
Very friendly and efficient, he helped me with everything that was within his reach. Thank you very much excellent service.","Positives:

Hate coming here but as a manager of business my company has a account here and I have no other choice. Am sure if this was a predominant white neighborhood the story would be different, but this area is 95% black and brown they don’t care how long every customer wait in line.horrible service I've been here almost an hour and they haven't helped me yet even thati had appointment i just hed to walk out they didn't even care about there customersWould give this place zero stars stay far away. Employee racial profiled me and refused to cash my check even after I gave her all the correct forms of I.D.  I went to another branch and cashed my check with ease. This place is garbage take your business elsewhere, not to mention I stood in line for 45 minsThe manager, coworkers and staff are horrible. Don’t recommend anyone to do business with this bank or branch. Their are full of it and when you go in for one thing they turn you away and say to contact customer service; once you do that customer service tells me that I have to do it at the bank store. This place is horrible and full of lies. On another note is like if they promote fraud to be done to your account cause when it’s done they do nothing to help. Worst bank ever and I been loyal to them for 7+ Years. They have lost my business as I’m going to switch banks.
I DO NOT RECOMMEND BANK OF AMERICA TO ANYONE.This location should be closed due that the staff and manager are horrible. I have a 6 digit business in california and they did not help. They basically worry about how i was going to spend our money. So please don't go. EVEN CUSTOMER SERVICE ON THE PHONE SAID THAT SHOULD HELP ME.Waited in line for 45 minutes.....to only move forward 3 feet. There was a total of 5 people behind the glass , only 2 of them working.I guess helping the other teller's out, is beneath the so called managers. This particular  BOA branch I only frequent as a last resort. Each time I visit I'm reminded of why it's a LAST RESORT.This is by far one of the worst locations of Bank of America, always short of staff and have constant lines of people and they just don't care how bad is the service!

As a business person I don't have an hour to stand in line.One cashier 10 or more people In front of me terrible service .UselessAnd I went twice to want to open an account and the first time they told me that I couldn't present my country's ID in my passport and I couldn't. They made me feel uncomfortable. On Monday I show up again in the afternoon to see if I have the option to open my account for my wife. You already have it and I want to have my account. They told me I can't apply. It's so complicated that, well, what should I do? The truth.Yesterday, January 4, I went to this branch to open a commercial account, Miss Karina attended me, she was unprofessional, she had an expired document, she talked to her boss and she told me we can't open that account, she cut me off permanently, another professional person would have given me another option, for axis. Take my data and I would say kindly fix your document and we will attend to you, he took an activity like saying bayace from here. I am an entrepreneur and I would not treat a future customer that way.

So I had to I zelle another $640 to my wife so she can withdraw from her account. The teller  was rude and not helpful at all. She just told my wife that the zelle transfer is still processing even though the money were already a part of the total available balance, and that she needs to come back tomorrow.

This branch deserves 0 star but there’s no optionMy Mother has been banking with Bank of America for 15 years. She got a thank you note from BOA and went to this location and got horrible service from the manager ( Mexican lady, her name starts with an O, I think. Olinda or something) 2 or 3 times my Mother had to deal with her rudeness and she wasn't able to help my Mother, didn't even try. She feels the lady is racist which is highly possible, or maybe she's just rude and miserable. My Mom had to go to another location in south Dallas and was treated way better. The owner keeps commenting under reviews to make it look like they care but you clearly don't if you haven't fixed the problem after all these bad reviews.. They deserve to be shut down treating human beings like that. My Mom STILL talks about that and it was awhile ago. You never know how you affect people when you're mean.walk up ATM broken on 10/15/23, long slow line for drive thru ATMThe wait times are horrible. The customer service is also horrid. There’s usually only one teller and one person in the office to assist people. If you have any transactions where you need a teller I’d suggest going to an alternative location. The lines were long and the branch manager failed to assist getting the line down temporarily even though there where ten clients waiting in line with transactions needed. I was the 5th person in line and my wait time was well over 45 mins. Just don’t come here. Maybe more employees or a new manager would help.Just awful.

The whole concept of ""customer service"" has been lost on them. Don't waste your time on this location.

After a poor experience (not to mention a 45 minute wait to get that experience) I went to the branch in Garland and managed to get helped in 10 minutes with a completely different attitudeWaited 1 hour to cash a check along with 30 other people in line with just 1 unfortunate employee helping us all,  greeter even got frustrated at everyone for standing in line while angrily telling us to crowd together 3 feet apart. Didn't even cash out the check they started kicking us out.Don’t bank at this location it’s terrible.
Every single time I come here there’s a line of 10-15 people with only 2 tellers
Avoid this at all cost matter of fact don’t even bank with Bank of AmericaCOVID is not an excuse. This location is the WORST and has been for YEARS. Don’t come here unless you have at least an hour plus to wait on the one teller and hope they dont go to lunch o while you wait. Also dont bother after work because they close at 4:00.Money was stolen from me by the teller first day I opened my account it has been almost a month and nothing has been done I’ve made numerous phone calls and emails and I haven’t received a callback or an email reply this is the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced and I will be taking legal actionI went to the bank to change a check unfortunately I did not have an identification at the time the person in his arrogant discretion did not want to change it even though he had other identifications with me my card on the same name and I was going to make a deposit I was not even going to withdraw Any money, so I had to go to another bank and in that bank they kindly changed it to me without any problem, they should stop being arrogant with clients in these situations since they are not doing us any favors, we are clients and you collect your salary from us.They just have one cashier, horrible service.Very unprofessional place!

Great people!!I went inside to change my PIN number…yes, I know that’s redundant…and I was meet my the Bank of America branch manager asking what kind of service I needed and then shown to the young lady, who finished the process.

Good job!Worst location. Everytime you go there it’s a waiting time just to get assisted by the teller it’s so annoying. I’ve been going here for the last year and everytime it’s the same thing. God blesses the time when I didn’t have to wait long smhPhone rang for over 10 min, no one answered.Was told I had to make an appointment for the next day in order to do something as simple as send a wire transfer.Inside always seems to be closed and the drive up ATM is busted 70% of the time. It’s like they don’t even care at this branch.This location is never open, call before goingNice branch great stuffExcellent customer service and treatment","Positives:

320,Bank of America,"6750 Greenville Ave, Dallas, TX 75231",Dallas,"I loved it,  the reviews i read are wrong. Times are changing, i know it can be frustrating, but sometimes an ATM can actually help you do what a human does not have the time for anymore.

I was greeted by Mr. Serrano and let him know the reviews are opposite of the service he gave. I dont have an account with them yet due to not having my documents ready, but truly would not mind having one here if he is there to serve the clients.BEST PEOPLE EVEER!

Erasmo and Gricelda treated me very well, resolved all my doubts and guided me throughout the process. They were super kind and efficient. Excellent service!Jose, the notary, was super helpful and friendly. He and Erasmos helped us notarize a number of important documents, even staying to help us after the bank's closing time. Thank you both very much!This is the branch I use for my business deposits for our medical office. Even after they closed the drive thru (which was a huge inconvenience) it was still pretty great….. until COVID. Now they have changed hours and barely have it staffed- I have been 3 times in the past week to make a deposit and they have not had a teller working. Of course the other 2 locations close by were just as bad because everyone had to go there and the line was 10+ people long at both locations. I will be speaking with by boss to change banks.I came in to cash a valid E-Check. The teller told me they wouldn’t cash it even though it was valid . Then at another location it was cashed without issue.Wouldn't even print out my bankstatement even after I informed  them I possessed no computer nor printer.

Every. Single. Time. I come to this branch or ANYOTHER branch there is ever only one freaking teller and the wait is forever long. Get it together BOA!Just left this Bank of America the customer service is horrible they went into the back for at least 15 minutes left the customer standing at the window didn't apologize for the wait didn't show any concern for their customers time just looked at us like we was an  inconvenience every time I go to this Bank of America the service is horrible Bank of America do better please!!!!!!!!!!Jose was great! Excellent customer service and was very insightful on walking me through opening an account.Wait long enough to get cashier's check just one person help all customers!Amazing service!! Very kindgreat service !!!!!! always awesomeTerribleI arrived before the appointment and Lili, with great professionalism, attended to me and solved my problem.. thank you LiliExcellent attention, super friendly. They solved all my problemsExcellent service and attention","Positives:
- Mr. Serrano provided good service and exceeded the expectations of the reviews
- Erasmo, Gricelda, and Jose provided excellent and efficient service, resolving doubts and assisting with notarizing important documents
- Lili provided professional and attentive service, solving problems
- The bank has provided overall great service in the past, especially for business deposits
- Jose was knowledgeable and helpful in opening an account

Room for Improvement:
- The bank's closure of the drive-thru and changing of hours due to COVID have inconvenienced customers, leading to long wait times and understaffing
- Inconsistent policies, as one location cashed a valid E-Check while another location refused to do so
- The bank needs more tellers and better organization to reduce wait times

Miscellaneous:
- The customer appreciated the ATM for assisting with transactions that may take longer with a human teller
- The customer may consider changing banks due to the recent negative experiences
- The bank refused to print a bank statement despite the customer not having access to a computer or printer"
321,Bank of America,"1520 Buckner Blvd, Dallas, TX 75217",Dallas,"Only 1 teller working and have 3-4 people I guess they in charge just walking around. This has been going on for a while already. Honestly they should consider closing this location for good.
Instead of BoA replying to the comments, they should do something about the issue.I'm closing my account asap! I deposit cash in atm and it won't be available til the 18th unbelievable, how irritating this can be. I need to pay my rent but who care for this bank speaking general.Andrea from the front was so exited to get my money. Took 15 longer inside but her smile made the experience way better.This is the worst bank location I’ve ever been to. They have 8 teller spots yet only have one teller working. I stood in line behind 8 others for 20 minutes before I gave up and left. Some of the people in line before me had been waiting for 30-40 minutes and after reading the other reviews it’s obvious that this has been an ongoing issue for quite some time.I Came inside this bank to do a quick transaction, So I thought, I stood in line for about 45 minutes no kidding.. only one teller and the line was so long. The only thing the managers did was walk around .. No one came out to help this one teller… Nobody ..
I will never come back to this banking center NEVER….I just recently opened a Bank of America account after being away from them for fifteen years and I totally see why I left them in the first place. This bank has gotten even worse which I didn't think was possible. There are no branches with old school drive-thrus everything is an ATM drive-thru and the branches that has tellers are crowded all day with lines stretched around the building. You can't get anything done with this bank. I cannot wait to close my account tomorrow.most of the time you only have one person attending the window and they have a lot of people waitingI came in to Bank Of America to open an account and they had great customer service .. Especially Nancy she was awesome she helped me understand things that i did not understand before.. She broke it down for me, she was very thorough with everything , i kind of talked her ear off lol but shebis a great employee.. Thanks Nancy you seem like a great asset to the company !This is one of the worst places ever the lines at at this place is worse than Walmart I doubt they have any idea what customer service meansOne teller inside to handle a long line of customers takes over an hour to get up to the teller.One cashier for 30 people every time I came here I'm tired of waiting for lazy bank tellers 8m changing to Wells FargoWorst bank I ever been to , stranded in line for over an hr and received terrible customer service2 drive up ATM""e in one lane. Moves quickly as long as people are paying attention and acting right.Very slow to service customers and poor qualityCan a put no stars?  Worst bank everYou can't put a review without filling at least 1 star but this bank doesn't deserve even one. It's the bank with the worst service, only one ATM with these lines and normally only 2 ATMs without efficiency, they say they don't have enough staff and that's for more than 8 years and there are always about 6 representatives sitting many times without attending to anyone and they do not have staff or appointments available, I do not usually come a lot for the same situation but sometimes it is necessary and I have to dedicate more than 2 hours, this is ridiculous.Terrible service, both at the bank and in their automated phone system, when I was finally able to contact a representative, they could not help me due to some problem with their system, then they transferred me to another representative, with whom I was never able to speak, for the blessed automated system. Their customer service definitely leaves a lot to be desired. It really is ridiculous how bad the customer service is.This coming to this bank makes me sick
The service is the worst, a huge queue and only one cashier and at the entrance a few doing nothing and I asked myself why they don't serve at the cashier if they're not doing anything!Very bad service
They leave you waiting and no one else wants to help you…The worst bank today, Saturday, they only have one girl at the window and the line is outside the bankTerrible service","Positives:

324,Bank of America,"2500 N Haskell Ave., Dallas, TX 75204",Dallas,"Most people only write reviews if they had a bad experience, especially at a bank, so here’s a 5 star review. My experience today was prompt and fast. Keep up the good work. A+ that the branch was nice a tidy.Came to deposit a check of $500 (my security deposit from my apartment) took 15 minutes to see a teller. Once I was seen, I deposited my check and was told funds would be available within 24 hours. Waited to only find out a hold was on the check and funds wouldn’t be made available until 13 days later. Deposited this check on the 29th which means I have bills due from the 1st-10th. Now I can’t handle my business because BOA. Can’t handle theirs. Requested my check back to cash elsewhere and close my account and even that was an issue.I went on a Monday around 10:30 am. Employees were efficient, friendly and helpful. Seamless process- in and out quickly :)I was just told I can’t get an account document in the bank. Please what’s that building for?  i literally have multiple account with you guys plus I called the customer care before going there wasted my Precious time.Zero help, like eating paint chips for fun. everything you need done will be done from a third party and not through them. Do yourself a favor and go literally anywhere else to do your bankingWish I could rate this place lower. Second no show appointment from merrill employee with no call or text. Run don’t walk away from this placeThis location is open but don’t have cashiers, so what’s the point! And you can see 4 people sitting doing nothing!Gave me counterfeit bills. Refused to give me my money back even with proof. Closed my accounts and will not be coming backA few months ago I visited the Highland Park Bank of America and had customer service issues. So I decided to drive further and go to this branch to get a document notarized.  Well, the experience was just as bad.  I was told I needed to make an appointment despite the person who is a notary was completely free at the time I walked in.  I needed the service right away so left and went to the UPS store who had me out the door in 3 minutes.  So much for customer service at the bank you have been using for decades.I love this BofA branch.  The staff are fantastic and have always provided excellent service to me.  Recently, Jennifer helped me set up my business checking account and business credit card account and it was a wonderful experience.  I'd like to recognize the staff for their courteousness and professionalism throughout the process.  Thanks so much!Why is this branch closed on a Monday????? I just recently opened a Bank of America account after being away from them for 15 years and I totally see why I left them in the first place. This bank has gotten even worse which I didn't think was possible and has the nerve to charge a 15 maintenance fee for NOTHING. There are no branches with old school drive-thrus everything is an ATM drive-thru and the branches that has tellers are crowded all day with lines stretched around the building. You can't get anything done with this bank. I cannot wait to close my account tomorrow.So none of the ATMS outside WORK? Lol jokeYou should give a raise to the person who thought it would be a great idea to only be open 10am - 4pm. Why would you want to be open at the times most people are needing your services?Love a bank with no bank tellers. They all went to lunch at the same time. Waited for twenty minutes while the other associates…I guess not a bank teller just laughed and shared stories in their office with the door closed.Really pampas to be a $43.000yr BOA employee.
Trained in sales and nothing to do with banking.
When you are management and then into retirement, you will be eliminated. boa* will find a reason to fire you before you get retirement. This is not speculation.
This is experience. First hand.
Shame on bank of America and any of it's dedicated constituents.Two managers side by side said they won’t have a teller for a week. You mean to tell me neither of you know how to work the teller window but you’re management?ATMs don’t work at night, choose another locationLobby not open until 10. Yet another way b of a can underserve their customersIf I could give zero stars I would. Every time I walk into this place during my lunch hour they either don’t have tellers for the day or they sent them to lunch so you can sit down and wait for 30 minutes. What ?DO NOT USE ATM there, I deposit over 800$ because they didn't have a teller at the moment, only on 180$ showed up on my account, I made the dispute they credit me 620$ but now the bank is taking the 620$ because they couldn't locate the cash. Now I'm missing 620$ on my account.This is the worst Bank of America location I’ve ever been to, every time you go in they never have any tell us available, and you’re not able to ever perform any transactions unless you see ATM outside what is the point even having the bank open if you have to use the damn ATM outside all the time terrible customer service here they always make excuses, as to why they cannot help you when you go in there’s never a teller available and they can never do anything that you need for a inside bank. TerribleBank says its open. Multiple people working. But no tellers available? Why not just say you are closed.Had an appointment to complete an important transaction. No manager or tellers there and I was turned away. Unacceptable.Started using this branch three months back. The service here has exceeded my expectations for Bank of America in general.Amazing service from Cameron. He was quick, courteous, and professional.Every time I come to this branch there’s only one one teller working and 2 people walking around greeting people while 7 or 8 people are waiting in line !

325,Bank of America,"6019 Berkshire Ln, Dallas, TX 75225",Dallas,"Very simple to open an account here. The bankers are very friendly and it hurts me to see people rudely generalising them in these reviews. My only star off is not of anybody’s fault but it should be known, that the drive through ATM is very difficult to exit when there is traffic on Northwest Highway, and that the BofA in Snider Plaza is much easier.I have always had a great experience at the Berkshire Lane branch of BOA.  Today, Eddie Magana helped me and he met and exceeded my expectations.5stars for Eddie Magana","Positives:

327,Bank of America,"3300 Martin Luther King Jr Blvd, Dallas, TX 75210",Dallas,"I went here to update my legal name on the account. A lady refused to accept one of my legal document which I already used to update DL, SSN, and other banks. I had to go back and called customer service and turned out she was wrong. She was unprofessional and not helpful at all. This location is bad.Pulled up & none of the ATMs worked. Even changed my pin cause I thought maybe the pin I been usin was changed. Still didn't work so I walk to Walgreens & that ATM worked. So I used Lyft to got to chase but I exceeded my transaction limit messing around tryna use the ATMs at this bank of America. Like what kinda goofy bank can't even have their ATMs work rightI have to go into the bank to make deposits for my job regularly for a year now and literally half the time I go, there are no tellers there or they're not open at all. Seems like they have 1 or 2 tellers on staff and the manager and/or other staff can't step in as a teller when needed so no teller= a bank that does no banking. I cannot believe the 2nd largest bank in the nation, that has over $2 trillion in assets, can't properly staff all of their banks. Upon reading past reviews, seems like the understaffing has been going on for a long time.Worst bank ever!!!  My work hours are 8AM-5PM Lunch 12N-1PM  Never open on time 9AM; closed during lunch 12PM-1PM, is the only time I have and closed early 4PM with security on duty!!! Took off work early at 2:30PM spoke with a female manager, who informed me it would take up to 30 days for my requested information to be resolved and verification received by mail however only to learn NOTHING has been sent to handle my request so I’m back to square one!!! How are they a service to the community?Waited in a short line for 30 minutes because they only had one teller, I believe this is the longest Wait I’ve ever had at a bank like this. 3 other staff in building but no one else would help.

Thank you so much Ronny.My husband and I came here for opening joint account, we are very satisfied with the customer service. Ronny was absolutely amazing and helpful. Thank you Ronny we hope you get recognized for this.If I could give them a negative rating I would. The thick neck Latina with glasses literally watched the one teller set an account up while we waited on line over the last 35 min. This is ridiculousUnderstaffed but employees are trying their best. The manager tried his best to resolve my issue.Justin was very helpful in getting my transaction deposited!Had a newly Army Enlisted soldier that needed to get a direct deposit form and the worker by the name of Vickie refused to fill it out for her even though I came in uniform with her. We have never had any issues with any other banks besides this one.
Poor attitude and customer service.I found the customer service to be really good here.  The tellers were very patient with the people in line and the personal banker was as well.  I just went in to make a deposit, but I was very impressed with the kindness and patience the staff had.The Spanish girls are so racist, they did not help me to withdraw my available money then i withdraw my money from other branch. Please do not go to this branch. They Closed my account as well. unprofessional staff.March 31 2022

No staff working. Only one new hire at teller office (who is doing a good job and very  nice). All the while I see a woman walking around with her coffee greeting people like a little poster model. I asked her to assist because there are 5 people in line she said they are doing the best they can. They have a handful of bankers which isn't sufficient so everything is on appointment basis. They don't take cash deposits into a person's bank account. Only money orders which are $14  so go across the street to Walmart for a $1 money order. There were 2 people other than myself outwardly complaining. One man said at lunch time their lines are out the door. A woman said she has been waiting 2 weeks to set up wires so she came in only to be told she should have made an appointment.  Bank makes money on our money but i am assuming that they are using covid (2 years post) as an excuse to cut staff and make more profit.Justin has helped me a lot. Thank you so much.I visited this location and received the most outstanding customer service out of any Bank of America. Special shoutout to Daniel and Meagan. These bankers really care about their customers and saw and treated me with humanity and compassion. My patronage here became more than just business that day, and I highly recommend their services.They locked my account so that i cannot send or wire money to anyone, they trying to hold my money.

330,Bank of America,"15110 Dallas Pkwy Ste 100a, Dallas, TX 75248",Dallas,"Updated review (deleted old one).  We just went to the bank to pick up currency and now understand why they don't necessarily answer the phone.  It's a small office and staffed with only a few people.  The folks we encountered were friendly and helpful, so I recommend this branch if you want to come in person.  Just understand they are short staffed so don't expect an answer to you call if you attempt this.This branch does not seemed to be focused. It is a shame that BofA, closed most of their locations and reduced their hours — though understood during these times.

But, though as a company we have nothing bad to say about the personnel once we interacted, the ghost town feeling is obvious and the attention of some of the personnel is a bit unsettling.

We will proceed to continue our business at another branch.Don’t go here! Extremely difficult to find, park and get help. I was obviously in a hurry and the lady took her sweet time counting change (she had to get another teller to give her change). I told her I didn’t care about the change just please give me my bills so I can go. These people do not listen! I finally got my bills and left. I will never go here again. So glad I finally got my account closed.The folks at this bank wouldn't help me deposit my checks or close my account. One of those experiences where you felt like the representatives were actively trying to be unhelpful.Horrible experience! They kicked me out without giving me a temporary debit cardThis place is a waste of your time do not I REPEAT DO NOT BANK WITH BANK OF AMERICA they accused me of money laundering and told me I have to be preset for someone to make a deposit into my account which makes absolutely no sense ally I will be closing my account IMMEDIATELYCharles was helpful and very informative.Excellent service provided by Natalie Benovitz, I really appreciate.Place is a ghost. They should just say permanently closed.","Positives:

331,Bank of America,"18229 Midway Rd, Dallas, TX 75287",Dallas,"This is the worst Bank of America in Dallas, Texas. I'm unsure why, but earlier this year they removed 2 ATM's and now they only have 1 drive-through ATM and 1 ATM in the front of the building.

Many times, one of the two ATM's are either; out of cash or there's a huge line and you have to wait 30 minutes just to get cash.

Save yourself the headache and stress and avoid this Bank of America.only 1 atm works at a given time. The hours are absolutely awful, and they have been awful so long that any talk about fixing them is a lie.

I would not like to visit an alternative financial center. I recommend everyone to change banks.You always have lines or 1 and only drive up ATM is broken
please do a better job with managing this location by adding more machinesAtm machine at main entrance not working, drive through atm had 3 cars in front of me, no idea why they removed 2nd drive through atm machine.Almost every single time I come here there is only 1 ATM that accepts deposits. I just waited over 20 minutes in line. They also close conveniently early for them to never have to worry about fixing any of these issues or being there to help you in person when this happens which is quite literally always. If you have the luxury to choose another bank or branch I would highly recommend doing so. This place is awful.This is the worst bank I have ever seen in my life. I own a car lot and and a wire transfer of 25k wired to my business account. BOA placed a credit hold on my account for over a week claiming they was verifying the wire. Boa then told me wire was verified and then I went to the bank to withdraw 10k and they claim wire wasn't verified and continued trying to hold my money. As a business owner it made my bills go behind because they was to lazy to place a phone call to make sure wire was good. Even after verification they still did not note the account. Emailed the CEO and never got a response. They have no complaint department to handle issues. Apparently BOA thinks $20k is some money and refuses to let u withdraw your own money. They have very bad customers service. I have filed a lawsuit due to discrimination and financial loss. I will never do business with this bank again. Stay clear away from this bank.I couldn’t even make a deposit for three days straight. They have the worst ATM ever. Everything is broken all the time.I am leaving a good review. For Ms. Chevez specifically at this location. She was very kind, respectful, and patient with me while processing my deposit. I was in and out in no time.

Like most people who have left reviews, my experiences have not been positive with almost all of my Bank of America visits, but I will say my experience here was a good one. Thank you Ms. Chevez!Would give this bank half a star if i could. Both ATMs never work. Might as well shut this location down if you cant service customersIf speed or customer care were a concern at this bank I would be surprised. I only come to this bank due to the fact it's the closest to where I live. According to the person in charge, keeping 7 people wait in line with 1 teller at the window has been an all day project, and is not very thrilling. I don't know what happened to this bank, but it ran much better when I first moved into Dallas, and has slowly gone to the level of quality it is at now. Do they really care or do they just go through the steps to show customers they're at the bank to do their job and go home?Worst location ever. ATMS are always broken. Lines are always ridiculously long because there’s only ONE walk up ATM and one drive up. Please do better for your localsA minimum 30 minute wait every time I am at this bank. Possibly the least helpful staff and manager seems unconcerned with long wait times and helping move the line of customers along. The last two times I am here I have asked him directly for help to get change and he has responded with no and sits at computer in center of branch not helping anyone. Today he said “I am the manager here no I won’t help the teller”. As someone who runs a business I don’t have time for or understand his lack of care. I look forward to closing my account and banking elsewhere.Bad service. Only two ATM , sometime work. 👎🏽 …In a 7 mile radio's all Banks of America are close and no tellers service or Business deposits we can't use a debit cardFriendly staff but terrible at keeping appointments and poor communication. Comes across as disrespectful towards me as a customer and my time.

Also understaffed and can't help with most basic things I come in for.4 lanes, 1 ATM, have to wait in line for some time. It's been like this for a while now.Bad service Mr. Dino treated me very badly, he wanted to charge me five dollars for a month, that is, I thought it was bad service from the man.4 car lanes and only 1 ATM. Only BofA thinks this makes sense.Never staffed to demand.Trash....HorribleThe best","Positives:

333,Bank of America,"12150 Lake June Rd, Balch Springs, TX 75180",Dallas,"Extremally unprofessional and pushy receptionist/manager, I think her name is Gladis.  Lizeth told me that I had to use my full name including my middle name as shown on my ID.  I told her I did not want to do that but if that was the policy I would comply to finish the process, but I would file a complaint later.  She got upset and said she needed to talk with her manager.  I said ok, please do, let's get this issue resolved.  The manager came in the office with an attitude and said that Lizeth did not feel comfortable opening my account.  Never a syllable raised, every bit of the communication was calm, relaxed and specific.  Review the video.  The manager could have chosen to finish the process of opening my account. She instead refused and said that she would try to get me scheduled the following week, because they closed at 2pm,  it was 1:40p.  All my other accounts use my first and last name minus my middle name.  That is my preference, this should not be a deal breaker.  This staff never offered me solutions only that they were going to refuse me service.  I don't know how this branch stays in business?  Poor business practices, power tripping staff and fragility are not a good combination in a competitive business environment.  Do better B of A!I’ve called this location all week from 9/26 Monday - 10/1Saturday at least 5-10 times each day during operating hours and nobody has answered me not even once. This is completely unacceptable that BOA isn’t answering or at the very least calling back customers to be honestly I find it completely inconsiderate and disrespectful really makes me think twice about banking here. I will most definitely be closing my account soon and moving on to a more bank that takes my financial security more serious.Never seen a less knowledgeable staff or worse procedure! They were trying to hinder my sister from closing her account by asking so many private questions as to what she owned and more, things that are absolutely unrelated to her process needed to. Lose account, of course due to her being a senior citizen, instead of lending a helping hand and making it easier, they made it more complicated so she would not close her account which I know especially Bank of America always tries to convince you not to close your account! I have to say one person at the end I think his name was Ricardo helped but not until I came all the way from Plano to assist and ask why my sister was being questioned like that. After 2.5 hours only were we able to close the account. Honestly terrible customer service over all. Closed and never opening anywhere an account in Bank of America.My family has been.  Using bank of america goto q really long time.I had an 9am appointment and no one was willing to help me. There were 4 associates total, and only one was assisting other customers with walk ins. Worst customer service ever. I am appalled. Set an appointment and still was never seen, after 35 minutes later I just decided to leave. Boa off lake June has ruined my boa experience if I could give negative stars I would. This is the second time I have wasted my time making here by making an appointment and not being helped. They need to hire a entirely new team.I opened an account online but and tried to deposit a check, but instead the account was frozen. I went to this branch and we had to make a whole new account. So then we got the sand check and deposit it for the new account. Days later the money never deposited and my account is marked as fraud.

How? I couldn’t even open an account because of all y’all’s glitchesWalk in, no one greats only one teller open.  Not very good.Worst branch/ location ever! The line was incredibly long, well of course only one teller working! Took about 45 mins to see me and only 6 people in front of the line! I understand the wait for a banker is about the same but for a teller to do something so simple, come on!!!! Ridiculous!!!!This location is ridiculous!!!!! The lines are almost around the building!!!! And always have (1) teller!!!!!! I don't even know how they do business like this and why am I still a customer!!!!!!!I'm always disappointed when I use this location. One human teller is not enough during business hours. Last month when I came in, the bank was open, but I was told that the tellers were out to lunch.understaffed, crowded and no feasible drive trough. Avoid like plague. Even a 2 hrs drive is better than waiting at this dump.el peor banco que he visitado en mi vida
avoid this place line is too long and the bankers are rude they need to get rabies vaccine before going to worksad, no customer service what so ever. They can't even answer the phone. take your business elsewhere.Have good customer service but I only have one teller always a line of 15 +Worst location ever , they need to hire more staff , been waiting almost 2 hrs for a deposit .I don't want to talk much about this bank it's terrible the staff is terrible I don't want to say more but this bank is rubbish.Nobody works the drive through you always have to park and go in.ATM took $1000 and now I'm having to fight and get it back. UNACCEPTABLE THEIVES!!!!Little narrow for trucks but very convenient!Long teller lines, employees just walking around not helping.SLOOOOOOOW SERVICE.Even 0 stars is more for themVery bad service.I brought some coins to deposit and they did not accept them because the teller said they no longer had the capacity to accept coins, what a bad service I do not recommend, I have had this bank with them for more than 15 years, it is always one thing and another with them, there is a lot of waiting in line or there is only 1 ATMToday I went to make a deposit and there were a lot of people waiting and my time to go to the cashier without exaggerating was one hour and ten minutes, because they only had one ATM, it's too long, there were very angry people 😡 and apart from the gentleman who is there Receiving the people, he did not let the clients in and had them outside lining up in the rain! For me that branch has very bad service and it's a shame because it has many customers!!!!Very bad service, they do not give solutions to such simple things, for a long time they have only had one cashier and they close the box so that the cashier goes to brake, I understand that but why not hire more people, if it were only for a few days it's fine but they've been around for quite some time... Solutions are needed, not apologies, for that and more -1000 starsMy husband went to open an account and the customer service is unfortunate. When they should be providing clear information and only rude to you if that's what they're supposed to be there for, to help new customers.Excellent service! They are all very friendly and fast. They always help me with my doubts! Thanks 🙂They have the worst customer service, it seems that one is going to ask for money from them when the money is mine, what a shame, pure inept people work there.Very bad service from both the manager advisors and cashiers… terrible they need customer service training or make a truly significant change…They are friendly but they take too long, they only have one cashier.

334,Bank of America,"2210 N Coit Rd, Richardson, TX 75080",Dallas,"I had a very positive experience opening a new account. As an international student I was worried it would be an arduous process but the whole thing took less than 30 minutes. I was helped by Matthew who was friendly and attentive. In the end, all I really needed was my student card and passport (and not the file full of documents I arrived with). If you're an international student finding it difficult to pay tuition from your local bank, I would suggest doing yourself a favour and opening an account near your school. I was able to use my account pretty much the same day. The physical card took about two business days to get to me but I had access to the online banking facility from the moment I left the bank. Still surprised by how easy it was honestly. I even got a whole bunch of goodies and advice on what to do once I started working on campus. All in all, would recommend this branch for new international students.I have visited this branch twice for opening an account and to get a credit card, the staff & the relationship manager(s) are very welcoming.

Banking and education are probably the two most important levers that drive the economy, rightfully so I chose to get an account opened with Bank of America. BofA actually saved the small businesses while the Waltons were taking away business from the smaller retailers so the trust factor played prime on me.

Special thanks to Mr. Zeeshan Siddique, he's the best there is, additionally he works in tandem with an Indian organization at the UTD called ISA so it's really a swift process to get an account opened with BofA.The bank manager at this location,  Asghar Khan is by far the most condescending and rude bank employee I have ever experienced. I came in for a simple transaction and was talked down to in a manner that was extremely uncalled for. I also witnessed another employee being extremely dismissive and rude to another customer because she could not speak english. I was considering moving my accounts to BofA, but I will tell you. This experience with this manager has definitely changed that.  And for upper level management reading this. Kindness, respect and positive customer service needs to be taught to this manager.  He has no business working with people.I had a horrible experience today redeeming a paper IBond at the branch. The teller gave me less than 50%of the true value. After being told she got it wrong, the teller was super dmissive, first using some reasons that theoretically were completely wrong, and then asking me to call Treasury direct for explanation. Even the manager obviously didn't know what he was supposed to know. I had to show him google search results to convince them wrong. After correcting the mistake, no apology was issued, no explanation was offered, as if it was business as usual. A five min transaction turned into a one hour back and forth and meaningless waiting. Can't imagine what would happen if the customer is not as finance savy as I am. My guess the customer will be shortened.I was really disappointed in the customer service at this branch! I entered the bank to see a long line of people waiting to see the teller. Only to find out there was just 1 teller. When someone came out from the back I asked if we could get some more help to move this along. I was told they only have 1 teller . Shortly after this same gentleman ( manager?) pulled the person acting as the teller to go assist a customer in opening a new account. When I asked how customers in line were going to get help. I was told he was putting someone else in the teller position ( really!!! I thought only 1 teller??) This same man started helping the man in front of me. I heard this ( manager ) proceed to tell this customer how he could do this transaction online! The customers reply was he owned a business and regularly makes large deposits ( money from customers that come in check for) and does not like handling online. Where has customer service gone?? I was there to get 2 $100 bills broken down into smaller amounts. Something that could not be handled on line. I remember this Bank of America branch as being customer service oriented. Just a couple of years ago. I guess it's time to look at local banks as our source to do business withThis place is consistently terrible. Long lines every time. Multiple employees standing around talking to each other while only one teller works. People waiting in line for over half an hour. Software is down.

Zero attempts to help or offer an explanation. Bank elsewhere. If it wasn’t such a pain to move money and accounts I’d never return.Horrible experience with Manager “Oscar” looking at previous complaints, it’s not hard to see where and why this branch falls short of other branches.
Being told I can’t  make my deposits because there might be a line, and smugly telling me because I deposit with a certain bag I can’t deposit at this branch? I even suggested using a trash bag instead of the deposit bag, and he said that would be fine. Ridiculous. Rather than starting the process to deposit, he wanted to argue and tell me to do a night drop. Your manager was argumentative, smug, and condescending. I have made several deposits at several other branches, and never have I been given grief like this. Never returning. Like I said, previous complaints show this branch is failing because of a manager issue.There is always few tellers working and a line. You've closed almost all of your drive up windows. People are always waiting, but great job though.Why have multiple employees if only one person is going to work. I waited in line for 45 min customer service is horrible. Thinking of changing banks. This is very unacceptable.We needed to wire money, and were told that they don't have banker.We had a very good experience.  They were great with helping us set up a new account.  John was awesome  so was  zeeshan siddiqui and kristie Trang.  They all helped us!Worst customer service you could ever imagine. I am done with this branch.Horrible service. Long lines. Only one teller working. All the others employees just talking.

This is why I'm leaving this terrible bankAwful customer service!!!! There were 7 people in line in the lobby with only one person taking care of them. There were 6 staff members but no one opened another window to assist. This is awful and a great way to deter customers.I don't understand why the ratings are so low for this BofA?? All I know is my experience there was nothing but amazing! I went there for notary service and Diego Ramirez was so helpful, kind, and professional. He went above and beyond to help me and make sure everything was done accurately! Thanks again for all that you do.So, DART ticket machine at the train station ate my $5, so they mailed me a check for the $5. They use Bank of America. So, I went to this location trying to cash the check.... they wanted to charge me $8  to cash a $5 check since I do not have an account with them!! Yes, you read that right $8 to cash a $5 check!! Where and how does that even begin to be logical!?!? Come on BOA it wouldnt hurt your pocket to waive a $8 fee! Obviously I need the $5 or I wouldnt be here throwing a fit! Heartless! Its your own check! Solution was to open an account, I would NEVER bank with a bank who would do this! Since I am currently unemployed, opening an account would hurt more than help! It would not be beneficial for me or for BOA! But they dont care! I am out of gas living in my car in the cold with a useless$5 check! But as long as they are nice comfy and warm over $8 Disgusted!Bank of America won't even cash their own checks . Which is absurd. As a customer I felt like they wanted to just rush me up out of there. They didn't take my business serious at allAll bank of americas seem to love habing only one teller on fridays...

336,Bank of America,"10815 Webb Chapel Rd, Dallas, TX 75229",Dallas,"Only bank available in the area that is open until 2:00pm on a Saturday. It was a little busy, but staff was efficient and pleasant. A lady was helping people in the line and was very nice, and so was the manager on duty.
Thanks for the positive experience.Unbelievable when you pay monthly fees and there is only one bank teller working. Line currently is at least 12 people long. At some point you would think issues like this could be resolved over several years.I came in to cash a check and was discriminated against the Hispanic lady told me she couldn’t cash a 308.00 check for me.. I honestly felt like it was because I was a black lady… she said it says in the computer you have to deposit it in your bank account and I was confused so I drove to the bank that was closer to my house and they cashed it no problem.. you guys need to race relations training because that kinda stuff is unacceptable…I've been banking with BOA for 20+ years in multiple states. This is by far the worst location I've ever been to. This time there were 3 separate lines. One I'm not sure what is was for and 2 for the tellers. I asked 3 people in the first line which line they were in and they said the first one with the lady working there and right next to her(she could hear me). I proceeded to the next line. Was there for about 5 min then she told me to get in her line. She then let multiple people pass me and then told me to get back in the same mine she took me out of.  Terrible customer service and extremely rude! Also during lunch time there is only one personal teller and one business teller.Hispanic girl teller is very rude and I felt as if she was purposely targeting me and being rude to me for absolutely no reason. I didn’t get her name but I went in on March 1st, Wednesday around 2:45pm, she should be fired immediately! I used to work in customer service and that is not how you treat customers at all! Horrible experience.The worst customer service  at this location some Hispanic employees need to learn customer service skills. I stop at this location because my debit card got blocked and  i needed a new card when I got there the Hispanic lady at the front of the line she not even ask me if I needed help I wait for like 5 minutes and I had to ask her for help .then she told me I had to make an appointment .  I'm not racist I'm Hispanic my self but I noticed the worst customer service are Hispanic  employees no matter where you go it will be alway a Hispanic person with the worst customer service skills. This happened Tuesday 17 at 4:15 pm  do something Mr Manager.Terrible branch. Tellers are always slow and rude. Bank is always dirty and there is never a manager. Plus, the business lane and drive up banking are never open. Switching to ChaseI wish there was a zero star option!!! The lady who I withdraw money yesturday stole $100 from me ! Now I want to call and report her and no one answers the phone !!!!!! I will come in person this week and make sure she gets punished !!!This bank has very clear deficiencies that have been reported to BofA Corporate regarding their cashier check printing practices.  They're printing checks using defective toner cartridges which has resulted in over a day wasted of my time since the dealership ultimately refused to take them.

The manager at this location is a clown.  He states that they identified the problem 3 days prior - yet they're clearly still printing checks.  He tried to gaslight me by saying that ""nobody else is having this problem, you're the first one"".  Even if this was true, you shouldn't be printing defective checks Mr. Pinecone.

The manager also accepted not accountability, offered no apology (until questioned about it), and most importantly... did not attempt to fix my problem.

After Almost 26 years as a customer (coming from Nations Bank), it's time to cut the chord with this bank.  They're truly a second rate institution and it's time customers realize this and make a switch.

Run... Run far awayThe service is trash. I had to wait in a long line just to be told I couldn’t deposit money in my account because I didn’t have my id. I wasn’t withdrawing I was depositing. This is the second time a teller has sent me away.Worst customer service the girl up front very very rude her name is Zaira beltran I tried to do every day banking since last 3 times I went in that branch and she refuse to do service  tried to speak to manager and instead of solve problem he did the same his name is Arturo ferrusca we are the big client of Bank of America we are not expecting this kind of serviceI went to this branch for a problem. All the staff were very kind and helpful. Especially Zaira Beltan was very helpful. She almost spent hours for me, And finally she solved my problem. Excellent banking and customer service.Professional service..Thanks a lot..Very good experience!! Went there two times !!! The guy whose name is salvation is very helpful !! He is very polite ,patient and helpful. Truely appreciate his workTerrible customer service. Understaffed. Call centers will insist you can just stop by. Untrue.

337,Bank of America,"2535 W Wheatland Rd, Dallas, TX 75237",Dallas,"I went there to cash my check as I previously had. Today, they tell me I can't cash to get money back, but I can deposit and get funds in the morning. They tell me the previous cashing were courtesy. I've been with this bank for 12 years, why do you require to insert our debit card...and put in our pin. Oh I forgot to mention, my check was in my maiden name. Am I lost to think that, when you open any account, they ask you for your maiden name?.And to add accident to injury I gave them my ID with the account name, and my ID with my maiden name. They required me to sign my check two times, once in the name the check was issued and on the accounts name. Never did they ask me my social, confirm my identity or give me another option. The verification process is flawed, especially when you have two ids.....and letting the
M know your name change appointment is on Tuesday...Pull your money from these banks.""Real Talk""
Oh I bet they'll give a response saying our representatives are courteous and we'll be happy to resolve your conflict. Come in and our representative will help you. Bahh Humm BugEvery time I come pay my rent in my landlord account it is full sometimes only one teller or two for easy deposit the two people walking around can’t help it should be a worker just taking deposits very poor serviceThis is by far the worst BOFA ever! The ATM’s are always broken. There are 4 machine and 3 of them were broken. The building and parking lot is dirty, full of trash.ABSOLUTE WORST BANKING EXPERIENCE EVER!!!  DO NOT BANK HERE!  I am a business customer that has banked with BOA for 12 years.  I went in to deposit a check into my business account, which check was drawn on BOA,  and after 3 and a half hours I left without them depositing their own check into my business account.  They would not do it because they stated that my clients signature on the back of the check had to be completely written out!!  My clients signature was his first initial with his last name spelled out, they would not take it.  Not to mention, I have been depositing checks like this for the past12 years  at least 3 checks a month for 12 years with no problem!  I reminded the representative that the check is drawn on their bank he could check signatures and everything to verify that the check was good but they still would not accept it.  I closed my accounts with this bank because I do over $300k in business a year and they gave me this headache over one check!  I was sorely disappointed and partially believe it was racially motivated.It was bad job. I would like send big money and I understood that I can't do it. Cashier put my money on hold on. Now I can't take my money and no one in this bank is responsible for my lost time, for my frozen money, I don’t know for how long, for my lost working day during which we didn’t rest, but sat in the bank.  I'm still in shock, my heart hurts. my money is still in processing on the account and I can't do anything with it, but I need to send it in the last days of this year.  all employees of this bank do not care.Branch Manager is no help at all. Did not want to assist with my issue. Horrible service.They told me conflicting information I got from the Bank of America app. Seems like they make their own rules here. *Edit* It seems the app was incorrect and they managed to help me understand the situation. They're understaffed so the wait was long, but the cashiers that were there were making sure to help everyone as quickly as possible. The manager was there just over seeing things...would be nice if they could jump on a register and help when the wait gets long.Received excellent customer service at this location. Everyone here was very welcoming. Jesse Casados was who helped me get situated and find a solution to my problem. He was very kind, professional and explained everything to me every step of the way. If you are trying to make an appointment to speak with a banker I would definitely recommend him or Eric!I arrived about 9:05, security wasn't even there yet, and there were 4 people ahead of me and 1 teller helping customers. By 9:15 there was still 3 people in front and now 3 people behind with still 1 teller helping customers. There were 4 other employees present but NO ONE came over to help us.
1 employee came over stood at the front of the line and talked to customers. Needless to say I wasn't happy or talkative. This was ABSOLUTELY AWFUL!! I probably will not return to this branch even though it is the closest one to me.Waited in line for 20 minutes to get a money order, and was informed they no longer do money orders. They have also started holding checks in deposit for up to 10days even though I have a perfect banking record and have been with them over 5 years. On the plus side while standing in line it gave me time to research other banks where I will be taking my business... Don't walk, run away from Bank of America... So done with them.Service is SLOW. I made an appointment and still had to wait. Had to reschedule. This is ridiculous!Very very bad customer service here. We wait 1 hour to see the cashier. Line is big and they have only one cashier and more people inside is walking around only.Nobody EVER answers the phone. And for some reason you have to wait in line outside to conduct business with the bank. Absolutely ridiculous and unsafe !!!This Bank is Nothing but Disappointing. I WILL be switching banks very soon . Always a long line to wait in . It’s always “One” bank teller . And not mention these people will HOLD your Money for Daysss. Us People have Responsibilities Bills to Pay !I’ve banked with Bank of America for 22 years. Never in my life have I had such horrible service!! 30 minutes just to see a teller because I think there is only 1!! I watched several people getting turned around because the inside ATM is broken. BOTH of them!! Ridiculous!The teller is slow, cause there is only one. We have to stand in line outside and wait and then stand in the line on the inside and wait. There is no drive up tellers so we’re just being inconvenienced every time we come to the bank. What a horrible way to treat your customers.Need to reopen the drive thru windows,  the lines inside every boa is tremendously long.. been banking with them since 2004, think it's time for me to go elsewhereSLOW ..if you getn PAID for a service, you should PROVIDE that service!! i didnt come to the bank to spend my ENTIRE lunch period there  . i make a specific pay because i MOVE quick to get my customers taken care of . smh .  yall business morals need to be taught . periodEven 1 star is too much.. worse customer service.. three people standing and tanking.   only one providing service... line is always out of door.Over 25 people waiting, Only one teller. I'm taking all my money out on this transaction. Never banking here again. Because this is a constant occurrenceThis bank is a joke. Long lines because there's one cashier. They never answered the phones or mails. In general don't ever open o do business here.Thank you Elizabeth Jantes you were such a great help today!!! I really appreciate on the assistance and making sure I had everything I neededStood in line for 2 hours, just to be told I can’t be helpedZERO STARS THEY KEEP SENDING MY CARD TO THE WRONG PLACEJesse Casados is awesome that’s it that the review!Long lines, hours of operation not reliable.They don't know how to do their job.Staff not willing to workNot the best location to goThe worst thing is that there is always an ATM and it is very slow, it takes 1 to 2 hours to change the check, zero stars.Excel","Positives:
- One of the employees, Jesse Casados, provided excellent customer service and was very helpful and professional.
- The building and parking lot are clean.

Room for improvement:
- The bank requires customers to insert their debit card and enter their PIN to cash a check, which is inconvenient for long-time customers.
- The verification process for cashing checks is flawed and inconsistent, especially when customers have multiple forms of identification.
- The ATM machines are frequently broken.
- The bank is understaffed, resulting in long wait times for customers.
- The bank does not offer drive-thru tellers, inconveniencing customers.

Miscellaneous:
- Some customers feel like the service they received was racially motivated.
- Some customers experienced poor customer service and unhelpful staff members.
- The bank holds checks in deposit for up to 10 days, even for customers with a good banking record.

Negative comments:
- Some customers had extremely long wait times and poor service experiences.
- Some customers complained about the bank's hours of operation, lack of knowledge and efficiency of employees, and unreliable ATMs.
- One customer mentioned that their card was repeatedly sent to the wrong place.

Overall, the bank needs to improve their customer service, waiting times, ATM functionality, and the verification process for cashing checks. They should also consider offering drive-thru tellers and improving their hours of operation for better convenience to customers."

For that reason, I visit them with the intention of giving them more business. However, their actions insult my intelligence and attack my character. So, I decide not to give them more business.

It is not the employees fault. They are just blindly following the instructions of the management and security teams. Therefore, the onus falls on those giving the orders.

Maybe cause I’m Hispanic… I do have money to open an accountWent into get a cashier check/MO as usually & was questioned by a woman today that was very unusual from all the other times I have came in. I tried to call the branch to speak with a manager but no answer. I was questioned by the teller unprofessionally asking me where did the money come from that was in my account(not that it thousands of dollars) but I answered her from working & then asked why was I getting it out today it had just deposited the day before. I then ask why is there a problem. That is what you guys preach to pay individuals 2 days before pay day. I am 110% sure she was questioning me like it was fraud or something. I mean these questions were inappropriate & I don’t know if it because I am a black woman but this was disturbing to me. I have came to this location several times & have never been questioned like that. But this never happened to me all the times I have been here.

He didn’t open our accounts I was appalled I called his manager, the manager said they were a small time texas bank and they had the right to refuse serive, that is true but it must be warranted.

The reps here are unbothered and don’t care if you have a lot of questions.

I would give -0 stars if I could.

PLEASE TAKE YOUR BUSINESS ELSEWHERE!!!!!How this bank has good reviews is beyond me.  As a company, their goal is to waste your time.  I tried to open a bank account with them online but they said they couldn't verify my identity.  So, I had to call them over the phone but after getting bounced to three different agents they told me I had to do it at a local branch. They told me all I had to bring was my driver's license but after going to a local branch they said they needed a utility bill and my social security card. Further, they write your private and sensitive information down on a blank white sheet of printer paper and keep it for themselves, saying that they're going to shred it afterwards.  If they can't give you the right information about opening an account, what's to make one trust them to take care of that. I'm glad I found out now rather than having to go around and getting my identity stolen because of their poor practice.  Sure, they'll answer the phone but I'm sure they're pretty reckless with your personal information.I opened a new account at Frost today as a refugee from Bank of the Southwest/then MBank/then Compass/then BBVA/now PNC Bank - I am closing my accounts after 30+ years due to PNC's recent takeover of BBVA and its institution of new systems and management that are not at all customer-focused.

373,Frost Bank,"20002 Northwest Fwy, Jersey Village, TX 77065",Houston,"Apparently this is a common spot for vehicle break-ins. I was inside for no longer than 15 minutes and my car was targeted. They have cameras but everyone from management to the police said it's an ordeal for anyone to even access the footage. Staff was friendly, helpful, etc., But I can't recommend anyplace which has weekly break-ins (according to staff). Perhaps if they worked out something to facilitate the release of footage for criminals actively scouting their building and targeting their customers, I could bump this up to a 3-star review. Wells Fargo has the means to do better, and they should. In the meantime, know that you're being watched in that lot by criminals.Had never used this WF facility before. Went to make a deposit. First time visitors might be a little confused by the parking and entrance location, but will appreciate it on rainy days. Was pleasantly greeted when I walked in, person offered to teach me how to deposit checks by app rather than having to make a trip, but I was in a hurry and only one person in line ahead of me, with 3 tellers in operation, so I declined the kind offer. Got to a teller in a couple of minutes who quickly and politely took care of my deposit.
PS: I originally thought they had a drive through, but that is only for ATMs.Beyond disappointed with this bank’s Wait Time. 3 others including Myself, left without getting service because it took 25+minutes. Ive been coming here once a month or so (not during most know pay days) and it is always a long wait time! The main reason is because they only have one Bank Teller. they need to improve on at least having two open. Every other Wells Fargo I go to usually has me in and out in less than 15 minutes.This review is specifically for Jordan who is an exceptionally helpful and professional banker.   She’s a shining star at Wells Fargo!The wait time here to speak to an agent is insane. If you’re planning to come to this location be prepared to wait majority of your day, if you come close to closing time you won’t be serviced. Setting an appt wasn’t an option as the next available one was 2 weeks away…Excellent service, very friendly bank staff and very fast with all procedures.

Franklin was very empathetic and determined to help in one way or another,and Martin was very kind and efficient throughout the process. I’m very grateful for the above and beyond service that I received today.I have never been so disrespected.

It took them almost a full hour just to tell me they could not cash a Wells Fargo check. That is after several people check out the authenticity of the check several times. I can get past the racial profiling I'm a black man it happens all the time . It is the fact that they challenge my character and played on my intelligence. The bank was fairly empty it shouldn't have took almost an hour to tell me that you do not have enough money to honor the check . I couldn't imagine the process taking more than 5 minutes to look at a check and say I do apologize sir but we do have efficient funds to honor this check. Then after they wasted my time, the security guard followed me outside like I was up to nefarious activities. The experience was disappointing and mentally damaging because I held Wells Fargo in high regards. I did not expect this type of behavior from Wells Fargo.   Congratulations I will never forget that experienceThe female representative who assists with drive through customers is deplorable. Horrific customer service. The location should be embarrassed to have her as an employee. I did go inside the bank to express my concernsDon’t come here unless you don’t want to be seen. Never knew it takes 2 tellers 2 count money… slow service no one spoke no one said anything as to why I had to wait 10 min for a withdrawal only to leave out to go thru the drive thruThe absolute WORST banking location there is with Wells Fargo. The frustration this place  has created ultimately made me  close my account all together. I was treated so unfairly during the rough time of my mothers passing, and this location  made sure to make  every step as difficult as possible. Even today,  I was REFUSED service because of a “death certificate” error. Even though they have a death certificate on file ( which was filed at this very location), and I made sure to call ahead of my arrival and was told by a banker it would be acceptable for me to come. Multiple occasions I have been treated unfairly due to bias, and given poor customer service despite being an account holder for 8  years. I  WILL NEVER BANK AGAIN WITH WELLS FARGO BECAUSE OF THIS LOCATION.  I posted this review strictly to save future customers the headache, as it is obvious at this point management here cares little about how their customers are treated.I've never been so upset and disappointed at Wells Fargo until I visited the 2714 Smith St. Houston TX 77006 branch. I've been a customer for almost 20 years even before it was WF. I was out of town in Houston and use the atm. The atm approved my withdrawal and said take your card. I tried to get my card but then it gave another message that said it couldn't release my card so I didn't get my card back or my money. I went inside. Everyone there were RUDE and were not helpful. The first teller said she doesn't know why It took it and that my withdrawal amount was reverse and I ended up just getting money from her bec I couldn't be out of state without any money but I still needed answers. She said they do not service the machines. She wouldn't tell me who service them and when so I could see if I could get my card back. I asked to speak to the branch manager (or whomever was in the office). She said no bec he had a customer but no one was in his office and the only other people in branch (besides me and my friend) got up and left. So another teller came over and said it was nothing they can do for me but if I'm confident that the atm machine took my card, they can order me another one. I was done at that point. Why would I lie about an atm machine taking my card. What would make him think I didn't KNOW 100% sure the machine took my card. I asked about closing my account and what would happen with the money bec I didn't want to walk around with cash. He told he doesn't know what would happen to the money and he doesn't know what my account look like. But I just gave my ID for them to see my account and give me a withdrawal. I just left. I will close my account when I get back home. After dealing with those 2, I wouldn't dare stay with a company who can't train their staff properly!Terrible location, poor services. ATMs are down constantly, why is this even open? They can’t take cash deposits in person? So why is it even called a Bank?

379,Wells Fargo Bank,"2651 Kipling St STE 103, Houston, TX 77098",Houston,"Always 1 teller working with long lines. The drive thru is broken (7/3/23) and they still only have 1 teller on the inside. I try to avoid this locationCustomer service at this branch is a joke!! I came in at 2:30 on a Monday only to see a line with at least 4 people ahead of me. Employees walking around looking at the line   Then one person came out and said we’re trying to find someone to help y’all. Ugh! This is the third time this has happened. Hire someone Wells Fargo!!!!Worst banking experience I've had. There were two tellers when I arrived and both had appointments to attend to leaving no tellers. I was late for an important appointment because of this. Either staff your bank or close it down.Personally, I have had good experience at other wells fargo locations. I came at 2pm. The place was empty.  Literally one teller and no banker.  Hmmm. The place was nice though.My elderly mother needed some time-sensitive in-person help on Jan 02, the day after New Years. We drove by on the hope that the branch would be open, since most normal people still had to work. But there was nobody there, except at the drive-thru ATM. We saw no sign on the front door either.  I looked up the phone number on Wells Fargo online and also on Google Maps, but I only got a message saying no one was available to answer my call, but hours were supposedly available online. A text search resulted in nothing on the website about closures for New Years whatsoever, much less reopening, so the hours availability message was a lie. So I Googled this mess, and there were lots of notices of bank closures on Jan 02, but none for Jan 03.

But when I called ahead on Jan 03, I got the exact same message from the previous day, that no one was available to take my call, and the same lie that hours were available online.

Must be nice, to give yourself a vacay whenever you want, ignore the phone whenever you want, lie to customers about your website whenever you want, leave your customers in the total dark whether you're even open for business whenever you want...

Wells Fargo? More like ""Ready to Work? No.""I try to make a deposit for my boss like I do every day and a Afro American lady didn’t want to help me because I forgot my ID, the other workers never ask m for a identification, I’m sure she didn’t want to help me.I tried calling multiple times to check their business hours but the automated system said to check online, which I did, it said it was open, but it's not. I can't access my virtual card, I tried customer service but they were unable to ""unlock"" it.Is always closed
Whenever I visited in last 6 months.Worse place customer service
Drive trueNever had an issueOkIt is a very bad service, to open a simple debit account…they ask for a lot of information as if you were a crazy strangerI made an appointment to open an account and they never attended me, when I did arrive at the time it was and I had an appointment scheduled","Positives:

380,Wells Fargo Bank,"5650 Memorial Dr, Houston, TX 77007",Houston,"This branch and the one on 59/Tidwell are THE WORST branches ever!!! This branch was good back then but all the tellers have left. There's ALWAYS 1 teller at the window - the past 3 or 4 times I've come and have waited over 30 minutes no matter what day. Don't even bother coming if you're on a time crunch and or need drive thru cause they shut the drive thru down. This branch and the other branch make the whole WF company look terrible!!! And I've been a customer since 2001! Ridiculous !!! Might as well shut this branch down, seriously. And just go to the one down on Westhemier by Central Market - you'll be in and out in no time.This is a horrible Wells Fargo branch- no walk up ATM and no drive thru service or drive up window. They also do not regularly staff bankers other than behind the counter--this means if you come into this branch to try to close your account they will not let you do itNeeded an important document notarized.

381,Wells Fargo Bank,"2714 Smith St, Houston, TX 77006",Houston,"I had a highly disappointing and unpleasant experience at this branch location. The Indian banker I encountered was shockingly unprofessional. Upon entering, there was no one to greet or assist customers with sign-in. The place was bustling with only three employees visible, and none of them seemed approachable.

In an attempt to inquire about a sign-in sheet, I politely interrupted an banker who was already assisting another customer. Instead of handling the situation professionally, she raised her voice and replied rudely, ""Can't you see I'm with another customer right now? Sit down."" I waited around for 10 minutes and she did not help assist anyone with sign-in and was repeatedly disrespectful with me, to which I got in a public altercation with her.

This kind of behavior is completely unacceptable and reflects poorly on the bank's customer service standards. I expected a much higher level of professionalism and courtesy, and I am thoroughly disappointed with my experience at this branch.

It’s clear that this bank location is in dire need of more bankers to adequately serve their customers. The limited staff appears to be causing inconvenience and frustration for customers like myself. Increasing the number of bankers available would go a long way in improving the overall customer experience and reducing wait times.Tellers are always there for the drive thru and they are always friendly.  I never wait long at this branch.  Even if there are a few cars ahead of me, the line move pretty quickly.This branch has no type of courtesy. I scheduled an appointment online & no one even acknowledged my presence when I walked in. After waiting 30 mins,  I had to find an employee and let them know I had an appointment that was supposed to be 30 mins ago. Not to mention, there was no banker available to assist, so I had to wait another 20 mins. Unorganized and unapologetic staff. Definitely seek another branch, before coming here. A matter that was supposed to take 5-10 mins to be resolved ended up taking over 2 hrs. Worst branch I have ever visited.Customer service is down the drain at this location, cant process deposits in the drive through in a timely manner, always getting an attitude when requesting the items to be sent back because there’s only 2 working lanes and the attending person take 5-10 min to deposit checks on the commercial lane.Seems they have no interesting in helping customers and try to push to other locations, disappointed and the worst experiences in this location, the management in this location is really poorest I’ve seen.

This branch manager should walk around intervals of half an hour, helps the emloyee to solve the problems, make things high efficency,  Don't let people waiting too long but nothing done.

See? I got the response within 2 hours after leaving this disappointed reviews, seems their gogole review team did a better job.This branch is always busy. Apparently they only want you to have an appointment to talk to them. I went there one time to resolve an issue about a tax withholding. They said they fixed it but it never did. They just waste my time. Go to a different branch or switch to another bank altogether.Non-existent common courtesy nor proper greetings. They just look at you, turn away,  don’t acknowledge customer’s presence or how long you’re going to wait while they carry on with their conversations in another language. Overall outdated, biased, unprofessional, and lack proper etiquettes. Rid the whole building….Today is DEC.10 I just walk into this bank to open account. There are 2 of people on the waiting list. I can’t found any paper to sign on waiting list. After 30 mins. Someone talk to me need to scan the QR code. After I done. someone talk to me the appointment was full no one can help today. Even still have 1.5 working hour! Come on! Are you playing for me? There is no walk in service?! I won’t go this location anymore! It's a show of extreme respect for the guest. I would not transfer my money to  Wells Fargo Bank!The lady yvett was rude. She can definitely explain things better without attitude.Very bad experience Ivette worse customer service she needs more training 😔 …Update your profile. I called Wells Fargo. You guys do not open on Saturday. Do you need recommendations for a new manager because I sense some incompetency?The tellers and bankers in this branch are helples , uneducated, rude and aggressive,  I swear I will never waste my time to go to this branch cuz they are pretty  bad behavior , unexperienced and aggressive  . I shout out they are horrible ,as much disrespectful as possible. They need to be trained not to humiliate and discriminate a customer.Do not have any business dealings with them. There are very unprofessional. I went there today. I want to open an account. There are 2 people waiting. It took a long time to get it done. AND They are talking about things that have nothing related to the bank. They talked for more than 2 hours and haven't finished yet. I was very angry and I left. I will not come back again. Finally, hire some professional employees to work. Thanks.WAIT TIME BOTH INSIDE AS WELL AS IN DRIVE THROUGH IS UNACCEPTABLE.  There is not enough traffic inside or outside to require this long of a wait time.  Ridiculous. Whomever is managing this branch is not doing their job.Nice bank. But service needs to improve. Today a lady help me and went beyond expectations. Really niceWorse bank worse customer serviceThey attended me quickly, I just went to do a simple procedureThe Worst Bank ever. I came on Monday, around 2pm . All ATM out of service. Only 1 banker. Its a long line for waiting. Waste my timeBad customer services..horrible.. i had bad experiences before becoming here again... I thought I might get some luck this time ....i guess something will just never change...""Froylan"" bad service, after 30 min. waiting ask me go to other branch.They're always nice and explain everythingDo they speak in Spanish?

This is the 3rd time in the past 5 weeks it has taken more than 20 mins to deposit in drive thru with NO CARS ahead of me. My deposits are too big for the app so I have to do it this way. Ug.Update: March 22,2023. it’s ridiculous. it’s 3:42pm and 6 people in line to make a transaction. we have 1 clerk and four folks in the back office. i’m fact one just left. why is the wait this long??!!! doesn’t anyone in the back know how to handle the front clerk duties as well?!! really? Past Post: This place has continued to decline. I understood the strict protocols during the height of the pandemic. But each time I come into this bank along with other Wells Fargo banks….I see ONE teller a line that goes to the door and 3 to 4 folks in the back office? Help me understand why they can’t get away from their desk and help customers in line? Nobody even answers the phone anymore at this location.

I would suggest going to other branches if you need anything other than the atm.Ashley’s service was amazing. She was very sweet and efficient. Her positive attitude and care overshadowed the long wait time.Always a 20 minute wait for a teller.Be careful with this location people are being followed and robbed apparently the manager himself said it’s been a recurring thing and won’t provide no surveillance to help8 people in line with only one teller, was told to go somewhere else by my own bankHorrible service.

386,Wells Fargo Bank,"12859 Kimberley Ln, Houston, TX 77024",Houston,"It's the worst Wells Fargo Bank branch I've ever been to. no line, but workers seem like they don't wanna work. only one teller working, and she is supper slow chatting with drive through customers. Associate came to check but couldn't help. And when I asked for help, she said I have to wait or use ATM. no customer service at all 👎👎👎I literally came in to get some quick information regarding my account and have been waiting 30 mins and only one person has been helped since!! Is there a manager who actually helps the tellers or other personnel while actively working here? I've been a Wells Fargo account holder for more than 15+ years and never have I seen such customer service beforeThis is the most incompentantly ran Wells Fargo that I have ever been to. Please get better staff that are equipt to run the bank and take care of clients needs. There is nothing but bad attitudes here and I can see why the ratings are so low. Good luck.I normally go to the Wells Fargo closer to my
House to deposit money. I ended up going to the Wells Fargo closer to work in Taylor st. I went inside like I normally do to deposit money and the manager told me I can go outside  to deposit my money in the atm. I was already inside and in line, where I feel safer, but she just directed me outside as if she didn’t want me to bother them inside. This is the worst experience I’ve ever had with a bank.Customer service acts like they don't want to help you. So slow. Maybe they should have more people work. Ask how they are no response. They could at least say ok   and then not speak
Horrible.Are you a former carnival janitor with a substance abuse problem?  Do you live under a bridge and have a second grade education?  If so, you probably qualify to be a manager at this branch location.  Terrible service, bad attitudes and unintelligible speech are hallmarks of this gem in the heart of the heights.Great Job of the manager, he was super efficient despite the line, great vibe and attitude from the staff with all the costumers.Came to drive through to make a deposit, I sent out the cash, deposit slip, my id and the debit card. Had to wait a minute and the teller came on the mic and said “YES”!!!!! No greeting nothing, I had to say and let her know I came here to make a deposit. I guess this branch new teamYou would think with all the bad reviews they would do something. I have to wait at least 30 minutes every time I need to get into my safe deposit box. They literally have two people running this bank. The people are nice but the Managment obviously does not care about customer service!This bank lacks so much professionalism. The wait time for the lobby is ridiculous. They only have one person working half the time. Every time I go I see the manager in her office on her phone not doing anything or even jumping in to help. Other Wells Fargo banks are not like this.
This location definitely needs more workers and a better managerThe tellers are nice and helpful but woefully understaffed.  I’ve never been here without a long wait just to make deposits. Additionally, whether you go to this location at 2:30 or 10:30, the only person who is a notary is not there.  The teller suggested the Heights location but they couldn’t guaranty a notary would be in the bank without an appointment.  The teller suggested another location that is close that has two people on staff who are notaries.  Possibly someone at WF could stop treating the Taylor street location like they expect to close it soon?  Maybe it’s my age showing but it used to be that multiple bank employees were notaries.  Is that not a thing anymore?Worst bank in Houston! This place is a joke. Other banks have less fees! Do not bank here!! Wells Fargo followed up with me and they had more useless ""can't help"" resolution. It'll be worth it once I fully switch banks! Can't wait!We decided to visit location today because the location on fulton is closed but I come to the sawyer location and let me tell I arrived at 3:05 to be exact to just find myself in a whole nightmare waited to withdrawal some cash for one hour here its 4:02 and after asking people to back up and a person in front of me could not leave because they could not leave because the bank had
her information poor woman she woman please send more tellers to this bank and this is not the first time we have issues with this locationTerrible! Been waiting in line forever, only one bank teller working and literally has not assisted anyone in line. Where are the the employees on a Monday? Why is there only one person working in this bank???New customer and the manager and or other members of the branch will not move from their desk to help.I'm not a fan of banks but Marlonde was very helpful, her customer service is excellent as well as her knowledge of banking and the Wells Fargo framework.
Thank you!!Second time there.... only one teller for the front and the back. She trys her best but wow only one!! Long waitsWas a nice and clean branch with helpful staff.Stopped in the other day and was attended by Denise I believe. She had a great attitude and was so kind. She actually made my day better!Worst Bank ever!! Been a customer for 20 years !! They will not notarize a car title exchange or witness the documents. Attitude and negativity!! Horrible bank !! Plain condescending attitude from both managers!!One teller for half the morning, unprofessional.Horrible. The black manager was not helpful at all would not recommend coming into this store.

387,Wells Fargo Bank,"6255 Bissonnet St, Houston, TX 77081",Houston,"No wonder they have one of the lowest-average star branches near this area.

They told me that I couldn't open a bank account because I'm not a 'permanent resident'. It turns out, that the teller misunderstood the policy, and I had no problem to open the bank account from the other branch.

Not professional. Just go to the branch on Kirby. They are kind and more professional.Second time at this location and the service is so bad!! The drive thru takes forever. Today it was more then 45minutes wait!!!!!!!! I called the branch and spoke to Manager and just kept apologizing and no solution. I'm at the window and told employee exactly what I was doing said ok and left. Then came back a few minutes later and asked a question. They are super slow and thats whats taken long more then anything. Please hope corporate gets this  and district manager. And the drive thru lane two is not working either.There is a reason this location now has 23 1-star reviews. Attempted to use the 2-lane drive-thru to make a commercial deposit and ended up leaving after waiting over 20 minutes in line. Thankfully I was not blocked in and was able to go to another location which served me in under 10 minutes. I wont be going back to this location as this isn't the first time I left due to long wait times. This branch can learn a thing or 2 about moving a drive-thru quickly from the Chick-fil-A in the parking lot.Went in with a simple request of depositing cash into my account and was assisted by Katia. She was very professional and provided great customer service. The place was also not busy at all despite being approximate to closing time. Definitely recommend this location.Im visiting USA i came to bank can’t open an Account because the need electricity bill on my name. Question is how person on visit Visa will open an Account?Jonathan was very help and patient. I went in very frustrated and on the verge of closing my account, he made everything very simple and easy to understand while also showing me how to fully use the Wells Fargo app. I would give the experience with him more than 5 stars if possible, great job Jonathan. 👍 …Walked in, waited in line, and got to speak to teller about wanting to open a new bank account. He informed us that we actually needed an appointment for something so simple and we must call in to schedule it ourselves. Disappointing. Went to Frost Bank down the street and made an account in less than ten minutes with no appointment.We are long time customers ( Not big customers , but long time) I cant get anything accomplished with changing an acct. I have wasted time going there 4 times to get online access and today No one will answer the phone at 9:50am?? I would Love a response from the bank manager. I would amend this if I could JUST get some help.The teller Jonathan discriminated against me for trying to cash my cashiers check from Wells Fargo. I just read the reviews and I see that there are other black people who have experienced this. This is evil and wrong. I will be closing my account with Wells Fargo.I run in, and I run out. 🏃🏻‍♂️
Sometimes I need something simple, and other times not so simple. Nevertheless, they always take care of me. I’m a happy camper. 😊 …Extremely slow inside serviceLazy staff they didn't want to help me told me to come back by 4 pm when there closingNOBODY EVER PICKS UP THE TELEPHONE THERE!!It's a bank.","Positives:

TEN PEOPLE in line with ONE TELLER. This branch should be closed or management replaced. Is there no money for more employees or what seems to be the issue. Having to wait 20 plus minutes for a simple transaction that is not allowed in the atm is insane.Slow service.  And I mean SLOW.

I needed to make a withdrawal but the ATM machine doesn't offer the denomination I needed so I had to get into the drive thru lane.

The teller sent a pen out but not the withdrawal slip and there wasn't any slips outside either.

Waited at least 10 mins for a different teller in order to ask for a slip because they all ran off and left the customers in the drive thru lanes without saying anything.

I think this location is either severely understaffed or something else is going on.   I didn't see many cars in the parking lot so it's not like they have many customers inside unless all the customers walked to this location instead of driving.

There are more cars in the drive thru lanes though but, like I said, no tellers to be found.

It took me an hour to complete a transaction that should only take 5 mins top.  AN HOUR!!

No explanation for the delay whatsoever makes me think this length of time is standard for them.

Avoid this location if you can.I been to this location several times never been help. They always send me to do everything online. On 7/6/23 I went to open an account at 4:15. The PB told me there wasn't enough time to open an account. If i wanted he schedule an appt for another day. I know it doesn't take an hour to open an account.  Especially if you're an excisting customer.Worst bank to go to, save your time and open your account somewhere else. Worst customer service here I'm bound to come here since my parents opened their locker here and no other bank had it. They'll make you wait so long that you'll cryTwo drive thru atms in this location. Most of the time one or both do not accept cash deposit nor have withdrawal available. You have to step out of your car and when you go inside you discover that out of 5 available service windows there is only one I service. One teller available with a dozen people in line...if atms are not being serviced you'd think they'd upstaff inside. This seems to be the case in almost every wells fargo I visit I don't understand what is wrong with this bank it's a shame truly for many of the customers who choose to continue to bank with them after many years of loyalty.

Update: Monday August 7th, 2023 10:10 am TEN PEPPLE in line. One teller for the reception area. One teller for drive thru and one banker. This is ridiculous. Why such a big building to have kne teller? This branch should be closed.I come here often and this location always gives me five star service!This rating is for the staff and the convenient branch location.  I love this location because it is so near to where I work and live.  The staff that Wells Fargo does place here are excellent. They are very friendly, quick and knowledgeable. Problem is Wells Fargo understaffs this location. Every time I go to the branch it seems like wait times are longer than need be. I understand a lot of banking is now done online, but in this location there are a lot of customers who are older and or are new to the United States. This market needs experienced bankers and tellers to help with all kinds of more complicated banking matters and there just is not the staff here for the demand. Every time I go to this branch customers seem to have long waits to be seen by a banker or get turned away by tellers because the customer has banking needs above and beyond what the tellers can do. A full service bank is needed here. Wells Fargo corporate does not seem to be giving this branch what it needs to do the job.I regret having an account at this location. They are always understaffed, rude staff, long wait time, never answer phone calls, are a few problems out of list of problems they need to address. When you want to use safety box, an employee stay with you. Weird. At lunch time looks like everyone went to lunch at same time and 1 person is looking after drive through safety box, banking and everything else. So wait wait and waitGo on lunch break to deposit jury duty check.  There's one teller, and a guy in a suit cones out to apologize, thank ua for our patience, etc.  Suggests drive thru or app, which I try several times but it will not process the deposit.  Here's a tip: in other customer facing businesses like retail, library, etc, managers will serve where needed.  So instead of just apologizing, GET BEHIND A DESK AND HELP!Highly unprofessional and disrespectful. During a time of a loved ones passing added stress and lack of training is not acceptable. It had taken me a week to try an close outy husband's account after he passed away. I was met with unprofessional and untrained staff at this branch. The branch manager was so rude and uneducated in her own job position it took other staff members how to complete her job ( Chantel) Wells Fargo is by far the worst bank and not trustable at allI was at this location & a the guy in my left lane kept watching me. He was there even after the car in front of me pulled off, but he never had his window down the whole time which was suspicious to me. There were only 2 tellers. Throughout 2 transactions he was still sitting windows up. He sat the entire time watching me then followed me when I left. I sped up to lose him. I called the bank and spoke to Shantel Web the Branch manager to bring awareness & she COMPLETLEY blew off & was VERY rude. I'm so shock she was so rude & I've been banking with WF since 1992 & coming here for 17yrs. Said she knows her tellers and if I'm accusing them I'm wrong. I asked why would she think I was accusing them? I'm really shocked she treated me this way. Contacting CorporateThey are always understaffed, long wait time. Not open on Saturday. It’s not convenientI wanted to get some foreign currency but I have to place an order and get it in a couple of business days.Monday August 7th 2023 @ 10:15am
TEN PEOPLE in line with ONE TELLER. This branch should be closed or management replaced. Is there no money for more employees or what seems to be the issue. Having to wait 20 plus minutes for a simple transaction that is not allowed in the atm is insaneOne guy and me got there exactly at 5 and allow him to enter but not me because it took me one minute to park my car. And we both came at the same time .and denied me .Made me wait in line for 15 min as if we don’t have places to me while the teller was chatting away with her clients that should be taken care of in an office. Horrible serviceHorrible service they refused to issue a cashiers check for me from my own accountWorst location ever.. went to make a withdraw from my account and needed to use ladies room and they said they have no restroom... pathetic!!!Horrible customer service I book appointment on December 30th  to January 7 on 7 the chinese banker  tell me that the system is down and she  rescheduled  me on January 11 @12 pm I get there at 12 pm 30 min after waiting for 30 min more she said  they can't serve me  I try to wait  for another schedule the same day or next day  it was not possible and so rude I'm will not go back  over I will found  another  locationMonday August 7th 2023 @ 10:15am

389,Wells Fargo Bank,"2005 Taylor St, Houston, TX 77007",Houston,"I came in to open an account but the banker didn’t want to help with unpleasant attitude. She said i need an appointment.  Don’t waste your time.Drive thru is unbelievable.
More ATMs !!!
2 ATMs and one is not in service

Updating 3yrs later still the same issue.
Everyone needing to use atm needs to go through the commercial account line.

Not even a walk up atm is at this location!!!Still here waiting in line while no one was ahead of me.  I pressed the call button twice and their employees have yet to even answer the phone call. The time is 9:50 am on June 10th 2023.  This is incredibly unprofessional.I don't know the teller's name but she was very  helpful. She had a smile before she helped me and when I left. I completed my transaction with no problem. You need more teller's like herSame exactly review as Crystal. These negative comments are unreal. I’ve been coming here for the past 10 years. And I have only experienced Great customer service. Please don’t take anything they do offensive. Don’t arrive five minutes before they close and don’t arrive right when they open give them time to settle In. Also keep in mind that most businesses didn’t make it through the pandemic, and the ones that did are short staffed and overwork. This bank is located in a little poverty area and I’m grateful they’re still with us.Tellers here are so nice and efficient, but I get it lately most Wells Fargo want to reduce employees and have only one teller for 4-5 lanes by themselves so if it's slow it's the company being greedy not the employees.
On another note they need to either move the ATM from the commercial lane of people need to understand that it is a commercial lane with ATM option, not the other way around as I've seen rude people honking at customers making their commercial transactions while they are trying to skip to the ATM ... which also often is empty and they are mad for being stuck at the commercial lane. So again Wells Fargo fix this before a road rage gone wrong ..Vanessa was so rude and UNPROFESSIONAL she gave me an attitude wasnt even trying to help me I deposited a check and I told her I want it now and in my checking account she said okay and  she did not inform me it wouldnt be available I told her I need it now she didnt explain anything to me she just said have a good day the 1st time then  I went to the gas station to put gas and my card was declined but I had to look for change to make it back to the wells fargo and I told her why didnt you tell me it wouldnt be in my account this is the 2nd time I went to wells fargo  and I told her i told you  I need it now and I want it in my checking account shes like well I dont have control of that and I even called customer service and they  told me they could fix it in the branch so i told her that but her response was rude and she didnt bother to help me and she said you can have it back and laughed said have a nice day I didnt to anything to that little childish girl for her to act that way never coming back to this location so rude and uunprofessional. Nobody deserves to be treated that way.Atm's are always out of order! Parking lot is filled with potholes. They need a walk up atm or 2 in outside in front of the business so pedestrians can stop coming from around the corner to use the drive up one,so dangerous. The location on Harrisburg is so much better!It seems like the staff here was slaved into working here, because last I knew to be hired THEY have to fill out the applications. They do all they can to avoid doing such.Very friendly and helpful staff in this location Thank you guys for your good customer serviceLong lines with 2 tellers in busy days, line is long enough to see the back offices. Just ridiculous.It’s unbelievable the drive thru atms are always out of service. And when they work they don’t work for long. The atms are a disaster.Horrible service.

Said it was to do with the company issuing blah blah. Enjoy my seven dollars wells Fargo because you obviously need it lol!Came in to the bank to open a business account. Alicia was the one helping me. Alicia was very nice, but she was not very knowledgeable about opening a business account. Almost every question I asked her she seemed unsure and uneasy. She was not very responsive to my emails before coming in. Long story short she was unable to open my account because the “printer/scanner”were not working. I was told by the manager I would get a call back to reschedule once the “printer/scanner” were working. I never received a call. The manager did explain to me that I was able to open an account at home online. If Alicia knew about this she could of told me and saved me a trip. I have nothing bad to say about the character of Alicia. I honestly think Alicia is not ready and needs more training.

392,Wells Fargo Bank,"2800 Woodridge Dr, Houston, TX 77087",Houston,"It was a frustrating experience that took me this Saturday with the first Bank in this country that I chose as the best option to open my first Bank Account in the USA. In a hurry I went to this agency to make a deposit first thing in the morning. Later I retired not realizing that I forgot my wallet with ALL MY DOCUMENTS including my Green Card, unfortunately I realized that I had forgotten it at said bank agency at 12:30 pm. I went back immediately but it was already closed. I had an international flight the next day which I missed. Because? because they simply did not have the time or interest in making me a call as I was a bank customer. when they have the obligation to notify their clients when a document is forgotten. They did not do it (I MISSED MY FLIGHT) I lost a lot by not being able to travel in a situation of high magnitude that I had planned in my country many months ago. IN AGENCY I returned on Monday and neither of the two ladies who attended me were clear in their reasons why they did not communicate with me, they did not know how to agree on what to respond since their response was different from each one. Then I called the complaints department and the escalation young man who answered me simply told me that it is the client who has to go back to get their things, and that they are too busy that they have to attend appointments and daily transactions to call a client because I forgot your documents. I never thought I heard such a despotic explanation. That perhaps we only matter when we take money to the bank and take bank credits. What kind of person gives such a response when they have no idea what causes an agent not to bother to call if a customer forgets their wallet complete with credit cards, debit cards, ID, driver license? , green card etc. when they were able to look up my bank profile and call me, I do it with my clients and my company does not have the number of agents working that they have. I los a lot of money cause they didn’t notified me on the hole morning.Well!!  Long story short regardless of taking time to set up appointments and receiving confirmation of your appointment once you walk inside this branch they can pretty much do whatever they want.  I scheduled two appointments for business and personal the rude banker that end being assigned to me was condescending and rude at hello she said  I only have one hour to spend with you.  So tell me which account is more important to you!!  When I demanded to have my two appointments as I’ve had schedule them previously, she said, either you calm down or I just won’t open anything for you.  I proceeded with only one account and I said at the end I will need the branch manager information. The banker got up and when to find the branch manager!!  Again!! Rude and bad service.  Fortunately Wells Fargo has many other good options.  Needless to say even though I had to take another day off I was able to find a much better branch with great service.  If you need to conduct business here, hopefully you won’t be assigned to Rosa Morgan she has a bad attitude and she is tremendously rude.

The branch manager stop by and even though she understood my situation she didn’t honored the 90 minutes time spot my email confirmation stated.   I’m not surprise why this branch has 3.2 out of 5 stars.Went here for a notary, the document was written in English and at the bottom in spanish for my husband's employer, and the lady stated they do not notarize anything with spanish, even if they speak spanish.One of the employees was leaving to lunch rather than asking me if i needed help they let me sit there for 1 hr to tell me i need to make an appointment on line when i told the teller at the window to begin with that i didnt have an appointmentI used to just come here to cash my check but I finally decided to bank with em cause at my last bank I got my money stolen three different times but nothin like that has happened in the time that I've been with wells Fargo, hell I wish I could give em 10 stars. The workers are always helpful and kind!They are always short staffedSince it's Saturday, why didn't you tell me in advance that you would get off work in an hour? After waiting for 45 minutes, he told me that he would get off work in 15 minutes and asked me to call for consultation after I got home. I am very disappointed with this kind of service.

395,Wells Fargo Bank,"19704 Northwest Fwy, Houston, TX 77065",Houston,"Shout out to Dominic, (DJ) for excellent customer service. I’ve ordered foreign currency from this branch a number of times. Usually comes within a few days and management is really helpful in resolving issues if they arise. Kind of a strange location. You access the branch through an underground parking lot.  The upside though is that there is plenty of parking.This location is always well staffed and waiting lines move really fast. I’ve never had a bad experience at this location. Tho I don’t think the drive thru operates here but there are plenty of parking spots.All of the ATMs outside are STILL out of order!!! Not good. Had to drive way out of my way to simply get some cash!! (On Waugh)Business hours online do not reflect actual hours of operations. There is a line of people outside that need service on a Saturday. I was trying to pay a hospitalized relative's rent that is due today. Branch manager is rude. Understand she has rules to follow, but she needs to make sure her ducks are in a row. A sign on the door is not helpful when customers make decisions based on online queries.This bank will close at the mere rumor of a ghost. You can count on locked doors and a sorry sign if there is a cloud in the sky, a light drizzle, or if it was an obscure holiday a week ago. Frustrating.Always friendly staff. I go there for notary service and they’re always happy to help","Positives:
- Excellent customer service from Dominic (DJ)
- Prompt delivery of foreign currency orders
- Management is helpful in resolving issues
- Well-staffed branch with fast-moving lines
- Plenty of parking available
- Friendly staff always willing to help with notary service

Room for Improvement:
- Strange location with access through an underground parking lot
- ATMs outside are consistently out of order
- Business hours online do not match actual hours of operation
- Branch manager is rude and needs to ensure accurate information is provided to customers

Miscellaneous:
- Customers have to drive out of their way to find a functioning ATM
- Long lines and lack of proper service on Saturdays
- Bank tends to close unexpectedly for minor reasons (e.g., rumors or slight weather changes)"
396,Wells Fargo Bank,"1350 W 43rd St, Houston, TX 77018",Houston,"I hate to leave a negative review but I experienced the worse non service ever. I’ve came 2 days in a row due to no banker in office or availability to make an appointment. The banker walked straight out instead of assisting a customer. I needed 5-10mins of their time but instead she was too busy running her mouth on her personal phone through the branch then left out.I will never stop at this branch ever. Very rude and lacks communication within their own branchThe branch manager Usha is a racist and she does not like the military. I do not recommend this branch to anyone. On Sept 11th she proceeds to mistreat me knowing that I am a US Army Veteran. No company should be ok with racism in this day and age. She needs to be held accountable.Best, best and best!
Ms. Usha Chilkepally. Branch Manager of this Branch. I have almost 10 years of banking in Wells Fargo in Houston. I visited many branches in Houston, but in this branch I received best professional environment. Its very much busy branch. Nevertheless I come here for my banking. Because everyone is here very much polite and professional. Its happened because the branch Manager is very much professional and polite. She always run from counter to counter. She always ask all customers if they need any help. But I have very worst experience from some wells Fargo branch. One of those is the Wells Fargo Branch in the middle of Beechnut Str. and Bissonet Street in Hwy 6. Whole branch I found unprofessional except drive thrue. Only one Cashier was working. She is very much experienced but very much unprofessional and not polite at all. Example?  One day I withdrawaled $4000 or $5000 from her- she counted my money from back side machine. After coming to counter- she asked me- ""do you need again I will count it infront of you?"" I was wondering for her unprofessional question! I replied - yes!
Then she made her face little angry and count.
Nur KhanHorrible customer service. I had an appointment at noon. Waited in the lobby 40 minutes just for somebody to come greet me and talk to me. When I finally talk to them they told my I still had to wait around another hour, so I had to wait 2 hours after my appointment just to talk to a bankerI went to open a bank account and was told to come back in 15 days because the person in charge was in vacation and would not be able to help me until 2 weeks. Was rudely treated and felt there was no attention to customer.selected WF locations are closed on saturdays. for this location hours of operation for saturdays is showing OPEN from 9-12. it’s currently 9:50AM: doors are locked and the lobby is empty. multiple wells fargo customers have been coming to this location for the same reason. if this location is also closed on Saturdays, please update your online hours. absolutely ridiculousbeen waiting for 1 hour to get my OWN MONEY out when funds are in my account. so stupid !!! dont even bother to come to this branch!! worse custumer service … dealing with supervisor was worse.If I could post no stars I would. The customer service is horrible.  The regional bank manager Usha has no customer service skills. She was very discriminative. I took my daughter out of school to open a student bank account and she said they were super busy.....there was no one in the bank. I have been a customer for more than 15 years. This was a horrible first bank experience for my 17 year old daughter. Definitely makes me want to switch banks.This place has been always under staff. Saturdays suck . Better smaller banks .Drive thru line is always quick. Tricky/Busy intersection at Bellaire/Hwy 6 so it always takes longer to exit out of parking lot than my whole banking transaction took. LOLThe public service is really bad. Sounds like they’re in a rush and I understand but it was apparent the lady did not want to help me.If there is a way to put 0 or - 0 I will give them -0 horrible horrible customer service slow Taylor's I have ever seen and they don't care for their clients I would tell all their clients to close the account on this locations are don't give them my business that is your money they make money and they don't take care of their clients it's a shame and I don't even know if anybody read this comments I will never set foot again in this location ever again in fact I'm going to go ahead and close all my three accounts from hereGreat five star servicePoor service and not professionalThis branch has the  worst service the manager  has bad attitude to the customer

397,Wells Fargo Bank,"2494 Hwy 6, Houston, TX 77077",Houston,"Excellent banking experience with Heather! I'm a corporate lawyer and have some pretty complicated banking needs. Heather knew her stuff, was polite and engaged, efficient with our time, and knew when to ask for clarification from her internal corporate support (rather than just pretend that she knew the answer and get it wrong which is what I've seen from a banker at a different major bank). I wish I had found Heather earlier when I started looking around for a banking partner because it would have saved me a lot of hassle. Great work!I had to call this bank for an issue with a wire transfer.   This is not my bank, but every single person I spoke with from the cashier, wire department, and fraud department was professional and compassionate.   I hung up the phone and felt very good after dealing with such friendly and professional staff.    I may have to change banks after all!I have been going to this bank today to make deposits but today I had a specific need and Heather made my day.  Very polite and professional as has always been my experience at this branch. Thank you, Heather!!I was in a time sensitive situation and needed to send a wire transfer.  I walked in without an appointment not knowing that having made one would have been the best choice.  The teller told me that the manager was with another customer and would be able to help me in 15-20 minutes.  I waited about 20 minutes and was called over by another person behind the teller counter.  She was the Associate Personal Banker, Heather Jenks.  She said the manager was going to take longer than expected and she would be able to handle the wire for me.  The manager joined us within a couple of minutes and both handled my needs seamlessly.  They were both very friendly and professional.  This is the best WF location I have found.  Thank you!If you didn’t know there is a tunnel then you might not find the bank location. This location tends to serve the employees that work in the financial center. The bankers and tellers are always amazing at this branch. They have helped me make quick appointments and take care of business needs.Looks like they are understaffed.

398,Wells Fargo Bank,"1404 W Gray St, Houston, TX 77019",Houston,"7 teller windows and only 1 teller open and that's daily. Lines out the door. Security yelling at customers to form a single line like if we are kids. Worst Wells Fargo for sure. No sense of customer service and time management. (owner) keeps commenting on these reviews but they don't do nothing to change. Don't waste your time here. The lines in the pictures in the reviews are no joke it's real.BAD SERVICE!!! They make you wait all day long . You need to scan a bar code to wait in line but they don’t have nobody assisting so just waiting for nothing. 😐fix your service Wells Fargo !! …This branch is a joke! I always have a hard time at this location, not only are the drive-thru tellers rude and lazy they are incompetent. They always have an excuse when it comes to cashing checks with large amounts, they must not know how to count when I ask to speak to the manager she always says the signatures don’t match and refuses to cash the checks even after I hand them my ID and bank card. I have a business account and if it wasn’t for the Wells Fargo on Eastex Fwy I would’ve changed banks along time ago! This branch needs to close down or hire better management!!It doesnt deserve not even 1 star I just did it cause you need it but service is awefull please is better if you close your locación dont make your customers unhappy you are loosing businessIn this branch you will ALWAYS have to make a longggg line because the lack of personal always one or two clercks on the windows.....waiting time 30+ minutes ALL THE TIME‼️‼️‼️‼️The biggest frustration is having to leave work early to cash my checks because I need the money available now!  And then they treat you with a horrible attitude besides that they didn't help you at all!  I worked for this company and they always said that we had to WOW our customers but definitely not ALICIA is not a good teller!!  The worst branch that exists, also their ATMs never work!  If you can avoid visiting this branch do so ‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️2 stars only because the bank representative that helped my father and I was kind and that was the only good part of our banking experience however the lady handling check- in, the morning of 6/6/22 was absolutely horrible. How are you going to be the 1st person someone interacts with at the bank and have the worst attitude? She was very rude and unhelpful and we continued to observe her speak to everyone who came into the bank after us the same way. Even my father, who's very passive, patient, and tolerant of the worst kind of people, asked me while we waited to be seen why I the lady checking people in was giving everyone so much attitude. I'm grateful our banker (Martinez was her last name but I can't remember her first name) took care of my father's account but I will not be bringing my dad to this location ever again.Poor customer service, we set appointments but they are the ones late. This is on 3434 Tidwell Road Houston tx but I’m sure they all the sameI have problems with my money every month it's something different and now I can't get to my money and then you need an appointment to get seenThis is the WORST Wells Fargo in town. I normally avoid it like the plague. If I could give it zero stars I would. Lines are always too long and the tellers are always slow. And they practice discrimination because their ATMs are not available 24/7, like every other bank in the history of forever. Every time you go to use one at night, magically all 3 are ""out of order"". This is neighborhood discrimination. If Wells Fargo doesn't want to operate at fulls service in this neighborhood, then they should GTFOH...Avoid doing business here.
Staff is doing their job getting their superior when clients don't understand material.

Head manager Mary stated
""LET ME SPEAK""
Where is listening to your customer?
I gave her this feedback her response
Was ""YOU INTERRUPTED ME""
Her employee was just doing her job getting her for us.

Mary obviously has personal things going on and made it a fact to have the last word. As we walked out she added “we all have our specialty”

Hers is obviously not customer service. If this branch is low performing or shuts down it’s because of her.I wish I could leave 0 stars very rude and always closing early very inconvenient!!Banked with them over 10yrs and didn't want to give me a line of credit 😤 …The worst Wells Fargo experience I’ve ever had …. The bankers are very rude and need classes on customer services . Here you receive the type of service that makes you want to close your account .

399,Wells Fargo Bank,"6783 S Texas 6, Houston, TX 77083",Houston,"This is the closest branch to where I live and me and my wife and the family been with wells Fargo for over 25 years and we have businesses account and personal accounts with Wells Fargo but the last couple years I believe every since this manager came to this branch she been so difficult on us she trying hard to make everything thing hard today we came to open a new account there and there was no customer but one on the counter and the other bankers where doing nothing
Long story short she refused to take us
I could call the 800 number and make her take us (I have done it before twice with her ) but I rather to go to other branch where I find respect and wonderful customer service
The Other branches they was helpful they took us easily and everything thing was smooth and respectful I think Wells Fargo should take a consideration about this manager because the losing a lot customersHorrible service . I been with Wells Fargo for about 4 years now .  I had never had an issue till today . I made a deposit couple days ago  . My funds took about two days to be available. So When I saw them available on my account I  decided to withdraw some of the money . After withdrawing some of the money all of a sudden my account is now negative and my deposit is on hold . I asked to be helped and no one can help me . Manager was in a hurry to go home therefore they just decided it is best for me to call 1800 number an  ask for help there .You lost my business due unflexibility from your employee, to open up a business acc i have to have my llc papers in hard copy? I told him that i could email it to him, asked if i could print it out, he responded in a way as if i was waiting for a favor lol, u call this customer service? Been to other banks and they were more than ok with e mailing them my papers and get them all printed out lol, i am stunned.Wow I've been using wells fargo for years with no complaints but today 11/29/21 was a different story I had a question to ask to one of the employees and finally saw one available, usually employees are friendly and happy to help but this ""lady"" was rude I said hi I have a question and she replied back saying I have customer that were here before you and I was like okay, I only have one question, so I left upset with mu question unclear. Unfortunately I saw new faces and they are not best employees. Not coming back to this branch even it is closer one to my house.This banks ATM is ALWAYS out of order!!

Sad.the people working there are so nice and helpful ans answered all my questions they went above and beyond to help me and get the best result possible every time i go they are always so helpful and dont have to wait for long times because i always make sure to make an appoiment beacuse everyone always has a lot of stuff to do and like that i avoid long periods of wait the only bad thing is that other  people just walked in and was trying to get help with the excuse "" i just have a question"" while i was in the middle of talking i also had questions thats why i made an appoiment i dont understand why people cant respect that and besides that the guy that interrupted got mad overall employes where helpful and relaly niceBlanca was a very helpful and explained everything to me about my accountThe slowest bank in houston visit this wells fargo where it takes years to make a deposit you never have just one or two employees.I use the ATM mostly, it’s annoying that half the time it’s always out of service and have you get sent to a different location.It takes them a while to complete a small procedure, you have to make an appointment for everything, they don't have enough employees and the wait is more than 1 hour 30!

Not coming to this location they don't care about the people oh yeah by the was a Muslim or Arabic person with verly hair. If you don't care about the customer don't work here.. we have family to take care worst experienceIt was Saturday morning10/14/2023 I told this guy respectfully and nicely sitting in his desk thar I have an emergency . Im going out of the country . They blocked my debit card because I enter  my pin wrong. I ask him to help me reset my pin.  It will take him 1 to min to do it . He didn't care and he said only an appointment . I can tell he enjoy saying Nooo . No wonder why he is fat like this . This location in the worst customer service service customer service in houstonVisited to open bank account and found very cooperative, knowledgeable and good banker Liliana Fuentes. Appreciate her on her professional and friendly expert prompt services.Not enough parking lots. A big line always, because they never have enough agents. You never can do a big withdrawal because they do not have either enough funds. Most of the time, ATM are out of order.Again I came in here today they have one teller at the busiest time and going as slow as possible. Stayed with the sams people for 20 minutes and had another empyee just standing around. Full line of peoe and they can care less here. Weren't willing to recognize after standing for about 20 minutes. I finally had to stop a lady and ask about seeing a banker and her reply, ""not going to happen today try another bank or scheduling. Even though she was doing nothing at the time and wouldn't assist me with seeing her or any banker. Just said what she said then walked off, not very professional for a manager.This is what happened 6 mins after I get out of this bank. I lost thousands dollars and this bank refuse to show me the video to help the police catch the theft.Mr. Angle was really angle to us…
Me n my wife open account & the way he explains the Financial stuff step by step as a lay man …. Even a kid can easily understand the financials.

Highly recommend ask for Mr. Angle & Mrs. Babita to assist you.Poor customer service.  Staff make excuses rather than trying to help.I have to agree with most of these comments.  I have been coming to this location for MANY years.   Last night at 4:30pm I was in line with two cars in front of me in the commercial lane.  I sat for 25 min in that line.  It was thundering bad and the bank lost power.  So when it was my turn I pull up to the window closed.  HELLO.. can you tell me what the heck is going on since it's still before 5pm and you should be working.  How about some customer service for those that were in line before 5pm.  Maybe suggest mobile app for a deposit instead just shutting the window.

It's  not the first time this bank has been out of order.  Between keeping the lobby closed for a ridiculous amount if time when the rest of the world has opened after Covid and also not staying open late on Fridays anymore I am really just over this location and will start going closer to home.  Which means I'll have to leave work even earlier for company business.

It might be time to re-train.Expect 3 hours wait to see a banker worst bank I ever been to…………… get chase or anything other then wells..ATM is ALWAYS out of order or out of cash. Fix this please.I waited for 50 mins on a banker and no one acknowledged me. I finally got in the teller line to request a banker and was told she didn't have time. This branch sucks and customer service is awful.4 Years ago this place was a mess, now in 2022 it has become a nice banking location, very busy  ... so be patient!  Good job folks from new management to all employees!  Thank You!I go there all the time but, new staff got little to know experience👎 …Bad costumer service,, an hour waiting and a banker approached me sayinhave to wait one more hour with really bad attitude, time wasted, they should give an advice since I stepped in instead of waiting and then let you knowIt’s not open on Saturday they need to update dates and times .Very nice and helpful.All staffs in this branch are helpful, polite , experienced and best services .ATMs never workPour  service...1 teller wait to longVery disappointed in the service that this bank is having.

401,Wells Fargo Bank,"3434 Tidwell Rd, Houston, TX 77093",Houston,"What a messed up branch this is. They make you wait for hours. Everybody comes and asks your name and vanishes. They could solve your problems during that time. Finally somebody comes and tells you you will have reschedule for tomorrow. I should have looked 2 Star rating this branch has before driving 40 minutes.I was told I cannot deposit change into my account here. Think about that, a bank that doesn’t accept money… Quite ironic.
I’ve never had this problem at any other Wells Fargo location in the past. Bankers behind the glass also need to work on their people skills, I didn’t get a smile, or a “how are you”, a “welcome in” or anything else that is normal at any other Wells Fargo location.
Only reason it’s 2 stars is because the inside is nice.The lady banker kay kelly racism us. We appointment and come before some people, they said i before 2 people right there. But after they kick us out, service for 2 white people come after me first. Finally i last one still waiting with baby hungry. Wait long time and go home with no thing.please whatever you do DONT GO HERE. i asked this lady to deposit a check into my account, and she looked me straight in the eyes and literally bit my arm off. now i'm armless & i didn't get that check deposited, so im broke too.New staff, have no ideas what they doing. They look lost. My last time going back here or better off change to different bank.Wells fargo continues to find ways to underperform its services year on year. I currently have 3 case #s totally almost $900 in regrets to this bank because of poor service and performance of service reps to support their customers. So after months of following up on the phone, it is extremely disappointing to be told no bankers in bank to handle customer service complaints and that customers have to take concerns online. The lack of empathy from branch personnel and willingness to support is simply appalling!! And I've been with this bank for over 20yrs!!

What is the point of having a bank if I have to spend countless hrs being bounced from 1 online dept to another. There cannot be a worse service oriented company in the business. When they closed the other 2 branches on FM1960W down to this last one, not having other bank options definitely hurts the customer. Were it not my strive to not leave without my money refunded, I would have closed out all my accounts by now. I feel like a hostage to really bad banking services.I've been with Wells Fargo for 25 years.  I haven't been to their branches in a long time I guess cause the customer service here is just as terrible as the their branch down the street from them if not worse.  I went in and signed in for a simple checking account for my son just so they could end up telling me they didn't have time for it.  It just seemed like they didn't want to deal with someone just opening up a checking account to me.  Rude rude rude! All those ladies there were rude!After my husband waited in line for over 40 minutes, the teller would not let him withdraw from our business account, even though he has a debit card and is a signer on said account. Worst Wells Fargo experience as of yet.I wish there was a no star review for giving out counterfeit money! I cashed a check here and they gave me a fake 100$ bill and is currently being investigated! I gave them a perfectly good check and they gave me fake money! I hope to hear back soon and get this resolved because no one should have to check they're money when getting it from a bank! - Terrance G SantiagoCurrency transaction is lower than at country of origin or foreign currency exchange booths. It is a withdrawal and than exchanged. You also have to wait to recieve the money. Therefore, there are shipping and handling fees, processing and other hidden fees.They don’t answer the phoneI love coming here. There is a boy who can also Spanish. He is very friendly.

402,Wells Fargo Bank,"6821 Harrisburg Blvd, Houston, TX 77011",Houston,"Love this location. Thank god for the new tellers Ashley and James. They have time and time again given me excellent customer service even dealing with the most unfortunate unreasonable people. The amount of patients they have with their clients is remarkable. I've witnessed God awful people giving them trouble on the teller line for over 15 minutes while I stand in line and they remain professional and hold their ground, still being amazing to me when I get to the window. The management is lucky to have such assets to the company. Please don't close this branch.I regret to inform fellow potential customers of my terrible experience at Wells Fargo on Wesleyan St., Houston, TX. I visited on July 12, 2023, to inquire about some unexplained charges and a savings transfer issue. Instead of receiving professional help, I was subjected to an embarrassing ordeal.

The red head teller with glasses, Ashlee, displayed an attitude far from professional or respectful. Her interactions were abrupt and lacked the courtesy one expects in such a setting. Technical issues with a printer resulted in Ashlee berating her coworker, contributing to an uncomfortable atmosphere.

Alarmingly, she disregarded basic confidentiality norms, shouting out my financial issues for everyone in the branch to hear. Rather than offering a private consultation, she commanded me to display my account details on my phone publicly.

Communication with Ashlee was a challenge; she spoke over me and offered explanations in an aggressive and rushed manner. When I expressed confusion, she merely repeated herself without making any attempt to clarify, leaving me as baffled as before.

The interaction concluded with her brusquely suggesting that I call customer service, passing my paperwork back without resolving any of my concerns. The brief encounter painted a picture of a toxic work environment and raised questions about the overall service quality of this branch.

I'm left considering switching banks after this ordeal, and I write this review as a caution to others considering this branch. Wells Fargo's service was a stark departure from the level of professionalism and courtesy one should expect from a banking institution. Proceed with caution if you decide to visit this branch.This is the first time that I've actually went inside this location. It wasn't busy outside or inside. Anyways, this review is for Ashlee... Your attitude towards me was rude soon as I walked in the door and I have never met you in my life. I asked for a money order please, and you kept saying cashier check, I gave her envelope with amount written down with cash inside of it. She said, it will have to be cashier check bc it's over 1k... I said, I want 2 money orders then thank you. She rolled her eyes as if it was a inconvenience for her, and said it's the same amount . I didn't say anything... Just kept my comments to myself, bc I know we all have a good and bad days.  So Ashlee I hope your day and life gets better for you hun...The wait times at this location are ridiculous because of the people in the area with attitudes and no staff. James and Ashlee really keep things running. Ashlee has phenomenal customer service and people skills. Please fix the ATM alreadyClosest wellsfargo to me so I go here all the time. Always helpful and today Joel helped me minutes before they closed with a smile. He saw I was upset because my complex shut down their payment system and last minute demanded a check and he had many people in the same situation come in and say the same. Made good conversation and had a great attitude. He should get a raise.Jordan was very irresponsible and didn’t want to help at all. Go to this branch if you want to get ignored and disappointed. Wish I can give zero star.A teller at the front desk has no sense of customer service.  She made an appointment for me at 4pm.  When I went to there again at 4pm, she said I did not made appointment.  Instead of apology, she blame me did not show her drive license and ATM card.Darlicia helped me today and had such a great attitude! I appreciated her help and how kind she was. Will definitely stop by again just to see her.Walked in to make deposit, no wait. Eunice was very friendly and helpful.I don't get it how this institution have so many and they don't have people working. It's  10 customer waiting online and only two people servingAnother well done!  Darlisha at the counter is polished, professional and assisted perfectly with what I needed.  Great location as always WF, thx!

Update: Still great location! Bank rep Maria just helped straighten out an issue created by another location.  Always knowledgeable and helpful here, they take care of their customers.

This location has always been the best in banking customer service! I have been using this location for over 10 years and have always had a great experience no matter what I needed.  Mr Odacha is very knowledgeable and helpful every time I have needed assistance the lady couple of years; , as well as every employee that I have interacted with at this location.  Keep up the good work!This location need to be closed down if you are physically disabled go elsewhere is what I was toldWorst experience ever with a bank! I’m surprised they have 4 star rating. The employees give contradictory policies and sarcastic comments.Laziest tellers in the world.Rude employees.","Positives:

403,Wells Fargo Bank,"7302 Bellaire Blvd, Houston, TX 77036",Houston,"I'm only available Saturday morning. It's always busy because whichever genius is in charge feels it's a great idea to staff 2 people as tellers. One felt the need to walk around and talk to people not in line. The line is now going out of the bank due to the lack of sense and competence. I'm glad this is not my bank. I've never seen this amount of buffoonery at any bank.Very bad customer service. I have appointment for my wife at 12 :00 pm ,When I arrived five minutes before,I did not find anyone to talk to or greet us. We remained standing, waiting for 15 minutes. Here, one of the female employees entered the bank, and when I caught up with her for asking her about my appointment, she replied that the employee who should take care of my appointment, is sick today, and there is only one banker in the bank, and you have to wait for an indefinite time, and she did not even bother to apologize, so I decided to leave the bank, and I do not recommend anyone to come to this branch.This bank always closes at any time they want, worst customer service ever. I'm sure it is not wells fargo saying close before 12 they have been close at 11am 10am 20 minutes before 12pm on Saturdays. Very hard for many since the rancho location wells fargo shutdown, beltway 59 wells fargo shutdown. Wondering if this is how the type of workers wells fargo has representing them to show they don't care about there customers service. Yes keep it up with closing the banks early 👏 and let's see how many more people will be closing there accounts and going to another bank way better service and most important are open the times it states they are to be open. Many came and was telling the workers inside hey there is still a lot of time till close and there response was were closed many left upset and very disappointed in the false timing and how no one cares for cu a customers business. If this is the way wells fargo will continue these workers that work for them treat there customers, easy to predict more wells fargo banks will be closing. Will see to be moving to another bank soon. Hope this helps everyone to stay away from this location and start finding another bank.Need more tellers.  Usually only 1 or 2 handling inside and drive thru.  Tellers are nice though.   Every time it takes me 30 mins waiting in line to deposit money.     They have 4 people working at the desk with no customers.    I guess I have to drive further to find bank that is adequately staffedThe teller took 15 minutes to tell me that they can not deposit third party checks.  I have been banking with Wells Fargo for over a decade for my business and all of a sudden they tell me this.  I have had problems with this branch in the past because the branch manager short staff and so the commercial drive thru is shut down half the time I go there.  Anyways, I take the same checks to another Wells Fargo nearby and had no problem depositing my checks.  I wish I could give negative 5 rating.I had the pleasure of getting a document notarized by the kindest lady that works there. Her name is Nicole Hayes and she is very courteous and professional in her job. I will gladly go back should the need arise and hopefully I will get her again.My mom and I had an appointment at 11. We arrived about 10 mins and as it approached our appointment time, no one even greeted us. We decided to be patient and considerate and wait a couple of minutes since a lot of businesses are short staffed. The whole time there was a person sitting by themselves at a desk on the phone. It wasn’t until I got up to go to the teller line to inquire about my appointment when she motioned me over with her fingers (not even a proper greeting). Turns out my mom was missing an ID, which I understand. I asked the banker if we could come back in 20 mins or if we had to reschedule. She said she had an appointment at 11:30. I know it takes an hour to open an account and she took us in past 11 (and only because I got up to ask a question, despite having an appointment). Why would she take us if she had an appointment less than 30 mins later? During our entire interaction she was still on the phone, with a condescending tone and barely making eye contact. We visited another branch the same day and while we were waiting, a banker greeted and acknowledged us even though he was only getting copies. That’s customer service.Today, July 14 at 11:40 in the morning, I called the bank to open a new account and asked if I could speak to someone in Spanish and I apologize that she answered me, she told me that there was no one who spoke Spanish. and he simply hung up on me when he could continue expressing himself or could help me in another way, if the person had a bad day it is quite unpleasant, I consider the person's silence racist, apparently he was a man with a mannered voice, it is quite unpleasant that not even calling the branch can obtain the information that the client needs for subjects like that, I will not open an account with you just for this, if the attention is like that, then that will be the problems with your bank, no thanksIt’s a Saturday and only 2 tellers at the window, and there are 11 teller windows!!c’mon  Wellsfargo who’s ever running THIS place, the manager does NOT know how to schedule employees for a busy Saturday only open till 12 and you know being HOUSTON you’re not just gonna have 5 customers till 12, as I am standing here there are 25 customers waiting in line to get to the teller window, bad bad service!!!! I’d be embarrassed if I was their manger here.I was going to write a bad review due to the long line and only two tellers working but I see there's no point. Based on all other reviews this is clearly a management problem and they just don't care.The teller plump and Spanish was very nice and friendly. I will definitely go back againThis branch is the worst thing there is they don't have employees and those who are there treat them with racism coming from the Branch manager for a Hispanic teller yells at her in front of the customers I had to see personally and the poor girl just bows her head scolds her in front and yelling at her she doesn't care that there are customers in the bank this incident happened on February,27 2023. Between 1:00 pm and 1:30 pm. What we can expect from the Branch Manager for customer service.Very poor Customer Service. My mom went in to withdrawal cash at this branch due to an emergency payment she had to make. She ended up having to show her license to withdrawal the cash and fill out a withdrawal slip but explains to the employee she does not know how to write and was only able to put her name on the slip (requires address account number and written amount of money). The lady refused to help her write it out and said it was company policy. She ended up getting out of line and going to another teller. He just actually at least tried to help her as much as possible without making my mom feel ignorant. Hope better training is being to treat customers more humanely. This was at 5pm and a Spanish speaking teller (wish I had a name).This is the worst branch I have ever been to.  they have no employees.  only one at the drive through and one at the teller window and I think she was new because she went like 4 times to the manager's office who was just watching how the line got longer and how people were leaving because of the waiting time .  The employee who seemed new had a verification problem and after she went to the manager's office 4 times, the manager came out to talk to the client.  It seems to me that the problem is the management and not the two employees who were just trying to do their jobs without help.Horrible Wells Fargo location ever! After waiting 30-40 minutes a lady comes from the back who looks like the manager with no name tag. comes and tells me they only banker there is is busy and three people who came after me already had appointments. The African American  banker with no name tag. who saw me come in didn’t say a word to me and actually watched and allowed me to sit there for 30 minutes. She could have told the person she was busy with to give her a second to come and tell me I couldn’t be seen. And this was after I paid for a lyft to come.They didn't not want to deposit a check and I did it on my app with no problem second branch I have issues with I wonder If is wells Fargo or is the people.This branch gives wellsfargo a bad name.  Employee late to open bank.  People end up just leaving .  Big safety risk making people wait outside bankNeed more tellers always short staff only one lady alwaysHorrible customer service.  Rude. No work ethic in regard to customersBad customer service, I had an appointment at 2:30, I waited until 3:00 and they never attended me, change all the staff so that the bank is successful
bad service I do not recommend to anyoneThe whole bank has only 2 banker, wastes everyone's time, 50 mins waiting for cashing out a check. Banker wears t-shirt as a young boy has to jump out the bed for helping his parent's business in mean time, 1000% unprofessional.Came to this Wells Fargo at 1:45pm and nobody there except the teller. She said the bankers out for lunch and dont know when they back??? WTH going on with Wells Fargo? I have never got this from other banks like Bank of America.I only needed to  change my pin, and they couldn't help me. I went to another branch and they helped me just fine. This branch has the worst customer service I've ever experienced.People at this Wells Fargo have bad attitude 5 time I have come here and they alway treat you bad . There are some that are niceSo rude and disrespectful! The worst ever experience in a bank! After an hour one of the employees said they won’t assist without appointment!Very very poor customer service ,Dulce had an attitude the whole time. If she’s like her job then she needs to find a new one.At this location: 1:30PM on the 21st one lady at the counter - rude (maybe I should digress - just lack of customer service skill)People are extremely rude , two tellers only !! no drive through, no security guard received $5000 but couldn't give $100bills 🙄🙄 …dont costumer service at all slow slow  costumer serviceLong waiting time and don’t assist SpanishThis place only has 1 person working apparentlyWorst customer serviceBad service.This place is slow slow slow.Today, Saturday the 16th, there is a line of up to 20 people and only one window is open.The very disgusting cashiers don't even have names to put them in but they don't attend very well angry like one to ask them well they don't have a way to everyone they talk very angry what disappointment because in other banks one attends well and not hereThey make him wait a long time bad serviceVery bad attentionExcellent service","Positives:

404,Wells Fargo Bank,"5625 Farm to Market 1960 Rd W, Houston, TX 77069",Houston,"I recently had a rather disappointing experience with Wells Fargo Bank that I feel compelled to share. I had diligently scheduled an appointment and arrived promptly, expecting to receive the service I had planned for. However, to my dismay, I was informed that another customer was being attended to, leaving me feeling like my time was being wasted.

As a customer who values punctuality and respects the importance of appointments, this experience left me frustrated and disheartened. I believe that honoring scheduled appointments should be a priority for any customer-oriented organization, especially a reputable institution like Wells Fargo.

While I understand that unexpected situations may arise, it would have been appreciated if alternative arrangements were made to accommodate my appointment or if I had been notified in advance about the delay. Clear communication is crucial in ensuring a positive customer experience, and unfortunately, it fell short in this instance.

In the spirit of constructive feedback, I would like to suggest that Wells Fargo Bank review their appointment management system and consider implementing measures to minimize such inconveniences for customers. This could include improved scheduling processes, better communication protocols, or more efficient handling of unexpected situations.

I genuinely hope that my feedback serves as an opportunity for Wells Fargo Bank to reflect and enhance their customer service, as I believe in their potential to provide exceptional experiences. I remain hopeful that future customers will not encounter similar frustrations and that improvements will be made to ensure a more seamless and respectful experience for all.

Remember to customize the review based on your personal experience, and feel free to add any additional details or suggestions that you think are relevantDon’t ever go to this location.  I wish I can rate 0 for this brand. Bank teller name Destiny and Arelete( Spanish lady) at this location really rude to all the customers. They didn’t wanna serve customer, ignore customer , joking in the back , wear head phone during serve customer. Anytime ask for separate the receipt or envelope, always get the answer no ( don’t u see we busy, even no customer in the line) . I called complain online so many time, still no action at this location.Came here in a rush and couldn’t be addressed in time, that was my mistake to dedicate such short time to open a business account, I get that. However I tried to open an account online and was declined so I will no longer do business with this bank. Such a shameDipika hayr  un professional races. I will make sure to close my account and tell everybody about Wells Fargo Customer Service how they Nasty and how they trade Who is not Spanic in the nasty way if you are not panic or doesn’t speak Spanish that’s mean you not welcome at Wells Fargo bank .This bank location is really bad service. We came here ask about wire transfer and they are doesn’t want to help us. We came to another location and everything done in 5 minutes.Let see, the reason I give this place is 1 star is about the inside cashier helper, they not friendly, all of them, why you go work and your job helping people and you not happy, I am so sorry if you think I am mean but peoples work in this place need more training pleaseeeeCame in at 4:18 to open an account and transfer over relationship from another bank. Was turned away with the greeter saying “we are not taking no more walk ins for account opening since we close at 5”.This is very unacceptable I came to pull out some money and the worker Dipika Hayr was very rude she showed me attitude in a very nasty way she was asking me very unnecessary questionsVery helpful and courteous staff.
Their representative, Evelyn, was professional and listened attentively, then made excellent use of time and expertise to create solutions.I haven’t banked with Wells Fargo in over 10 years, but I’m sure they’re still an excellent bankJulieta is a very good banker, she is very professional and she explained things I didn’t know about my account.My experience  was quick...... used the drive thru to make a deposit.Excellent service not like other branches.Please update website that the lobby is closed Saturday's. I wasted a trip.
ThanksExcellent serviceIt is really a disastrous service. If I go to the bank in person, it is because I have a problem that I need to resolve with someone personally. My friend and I had totally different problems and the ladies at the front have not even let us go to see what our accounts had, the two clarified. different days, with my friend I went today and the girl made us wait then they replaced her and she got another one we waited an hour to spend with a banker when this lady sees our name she calls my friend she had anomalies in her account because someone from another Wellfarco Bank told him and told him to activate his card personally at the bank, which we did. We also explained that we wanted to pass because we also had problems with Zelle, but we got tired of explaining to the lady and it was better to leave, we just went to waste time.The bank was a disaster, today I had the entire account in negative because my direct deposit did not appear that I did my job, it was in the afternoon to the bank and what the person who assisted me told me was that she couldn't do anything and I asked her for a appointment for Monday and it says everything is full, we can't serve you more people, what they don't know is that I'm going to make my appointment online and I'm going to change banks, it's useless, you have an emergency and what do you do? He who believes that his money is safe in the bank 😡😡😡😡😡Bad experience. If you want them to make you go through a procedure 30 times and tell you different things, go to this bank.The treatment and education was not pleasant at all, in short, a waste of time in the end they did not help me solve the problem","Positives:
- Helpful and courteous staff
- Representative Evelyn was professional and attentive
- Julieta is a good banker, professional and knowledgeable
- Quick service at the drive-thru
- Excellent service, unlike other branches

Room for Improvement:
- Honor scheduled appointments and minimize delays

405,Wells Fargo Bank,"5311 Weslayan St, Houston, TX 77005",Houston,"I had a “not so great experience” at this location. Yesterday, I went to a different branch to open a checking account for a check I wanted to cash, separate from my US Bank. I was informed that I needed to make an appointment and I was completely fine with that. The branch I was at yesterday said that this Wells Fargo branch had a time for 9:30AM. I said that was fine and made the appointment. I got to this Wells Fargo branch - 5175 W 34th St, today at 9:31AM.

I waited in line like any normal person would, but it took 10 minutes to get to me and everyone was busy, so again, I waited politely. When it was my turn in line, I was informed that they gave my appointment to someone else because the time was now 9:41AM. The lady, Deborah told me “because you didn’t speak to anyone, you missed you appointment and we gave it to someone else.”

Deborah said I would have to wait after someone. I didn’t wait and cashed my check instead of in an account because I had to leave and when Deborah counted my money, it’s almost like she overemphasized the container in which she had my money in was empty by acting like she was dumping it out.

On the bright side, I got my money in full, but definitely will not be banking with Wells Fargo. The other lady was much nicer and handled my money with more grace than Deborah did.I had a very unique international issue and Deborah and Syed were amazing, helpful, kind and they got me what i needed. Thank youThe manager Deborah was incredibly rude and angry when I said I wanted a Debit Card and digital wallet is not the same thing. This visit ended my 15 year long banking relationship with Wells Fargo. Horrendous customer serviceIncompetent. Go to another branch. Wife and I went in for a name change. Banker and manager attempted to tell us that I could not hyphenate my last name to incorporate my wife’s name. They thought the marriage license we presented only entitled us to add my name onto my wife’s last name, but not my wife’s name onto my last name. We told them this was not legally correct, but the manager insisted that they had to verify because the husband does not normally change their name. They had to call WF Legal to verify that yes, they could indeed change my last name to hyphenate with my wife’s name. We felt insulted and talked down to by both the banker and manager. We will not be back to this location.I left Wells Fargo roughly 5 years ago and today I almost gave them another chance, to start a business account. I thought maybe things had changed under new cooperation structuring. That optimism soon out the window when I went to the branch at 5175 W 34th. The manager Deborah  was rude and pushy.The manager of this place doesn’t know what he’s talking about. TerribleSyed Akbar helped me make a deposit today. There were two other female tellers who were not helping while there were 5 people in line. Syed was the only teller willing to help everyone else seemed to be fed up.This location soo bad that they closed it down for frauds 💀 Best location its at Long Point & Wirt …been with them for over 20 years.Bad customer service, bad management ten peoples in line only one teller, very slowJust an unacceptable Bank only has one teller on a Friday knowing that everybody has to cash their check on a Friday very rude and no consideration whatsoever I will never come back to that bank ever againVeronica is lazy she doesn’t want to help

406,Wells Fargo Bank,"10005 Beechnut St, Houston, TX 77072",Houston,"Worst location in the city. Always unprofessional. Always has long lines. Only ever has one teller working at a time. Expect long lines and longer waits. Wells Fargo standards for employees are low and it’s reflecting. All other reviews say the same thing. 1 teller working and lines out the door. Obviously they don’t plan on making changes.I am a customer having vested a good amount of money and property. The bank itself revamped but the staff service did not. I understood that the formalities for large transactions are handled at the teller line. I needed assistance for withdrawing a large amount and was told to withdraw from the ATM twice like a 3rd class citizen.Absolutely terrible service. There’s one teller and she was efficient and did her job. But, if you need other services they’ll literally act like they don’t see you and take forever to get to you. I’ve come two days straight and still haven’t been helped with a simple task. They look you directly in your face and go to the back as if they don’t see people waiting. Your time is not important nor is your business.The service day is really bad. I know I didn’t have an appointment but I was the only one waiting, and Noel person that had an appointment have made it there and they had me waiting more than an hour and a half about to be two hours and all they did was just going to say their office or whatever lay behind the counter and just stand there until people that had an appointment came in.The banker does not help Hispanic people, she looks for any excuse not to serve them.🤬 …First time in here and actually NOT IMPRESSED!!! They service the Hispanic customers first and make everyone else wait! NO BANKERS IN THE BRANCH!! NOT FRIENDLY AND THEY MAKE YOU WAIT A RIDICULOUSLY LONG TIME FOR NOTHING! The Security is sitting on her phone in the BACK of the room!!!! This is TOTALLY UnacceptableI am a customer for Wells Fargo for a very long time. Even my account is with them… I came to this branch and brought someone to open an account. We were sitting and we were ignored, I had to call the branch number and finally somebody came and explain to us and said they don’t greet , very rude lady , the funny thing is she could see us from her office door and was ignoring us… I have a business and I know you have to greet people, other banks That I have been to greet and ask if you need help and direct you… Love people it’s your job and be nice it doesn’t cost you anything.. you get paid because of the customer remember that. God bless you and change your management and attitudeWaiting in line for over 30 min to make a deposit only 1 lady at counter workingSuper super SLOW service! I do not recommend if you enjoy waiting 20-35 minutes before being assisted and no drive thru option. Plus place smell like MOLD.If I could give this branch a zero I would. The employees are nice and helpful but getting to speak to them is the problem. I waited over an hour just to find out there were two appointments that would go before me.There should be a team member that notifies you of an expected wait time. I will never use this location going forward.Easily one of the most useless Wells Fargo I’ve ever been too. The branch manager is insanely rude and just says “sorry our system says this” if she doesn’t want to do anything. Not to mention getting them on the phone is impossible since they also just hang up the phone if it rings.This is the worst location known to man. We have waited over an hour after being the only people inside. Just for the lady to say oh they are at lunch. Why couldn't you tell us that in the beginning.

408,Wells Fargo Bank,"5175 W 34th St, Houston, TX 77092",Houston,"Horrible experience over all with the branch manager Jordan Richards she was very rude and unprofessional she was discriminating us and stereo typing us she never greeted my step dad and he is  actually a wells Fargo customer he is been having a checking account for a while , he wanted to open a business account because of the relationship he has with wells fargo but she started saying you need to bring the envelope with mail to proof is actually is real because of fraud and there where as telling her you never greeted him or check who he was before talking to us that way he has his Valid DL to verify who he is and before assuming that we wanting to do some type of fraud  before checking he was a wells fargo customer she had a ugly demeanor  no way will i or my step that ever go. We went to another branch and we got assisted and treated right not like this place.Best Wells Fargo management ever, they helped me and my wife to get a joint account for us on the meanwhile she didn't had her SS number.This location has very kind, professional, friendly staff, Luis for example, goes above and beyond trying to help customers. On the contrary, Lisa Marie, and the manager Majida Kassewan, specially on Fridays, are so eager to leave right at 5 o'clock, to the point of being rude when a asked for a simple thing such as adding the amounts of the checks to the receipt. Lisa said, it's already ""almost"" 5pm and I do not have the time to do ""my diligence"" when you get here so late. Despite their attitude, I was not going to review them badly, however, they took the time to tell my coworker, I was the rude one, and that ""my responsibility"" was to get there BEFORE 4:30 pm to attend my request, when all I'm asking is for her to do her job, which the other tellers do without hesitation. I believe I deserve the same, cordial, professional treatment when I get there either at 4pm, 4:30pm, or 2 minutes before 5PM, not only with the business account but as a personal account member as well. I will continue to attend this location, and I hope Lisa and Majida treat me accordingly in the future.Majida Is a very horrible banker.
She wouldn't let me withdraw money from my account because my driver's license is from Alaska and she wanted a proof of residency. She needs to understand that people do travel all across the country and no one needs to carry proofs while traveling.  I went to the other branch and got my money no problems.Terrible service, very bad attitude from Majida Kassewan, Associate Personal Banker. She treated me as if I were a dumb, she said that she was alone for customer service, asked me if I thought it was fair and that she didn't care, that she is paid the same anyway. So, stay away from Wells Fargo Westchase Banking Center.No one even greeted me after I walked in and was the only customer for at least 15 mins.This branch needs to shut down. Bankers leave their desks to chitchat with tellers with multiple people waiting. Tellers are rude too, why is everyone here having a bad day. Go to the Wells Fargo down the street or literally anywhere elseThank you so much ""Tamara Santana""  I was trying to deposit my check tru the app, didn't work 😩 but help me out 😁😁🤗 …I’ve try to speak twice in two different days with an agent at this location and it’s not possible, they are always on lunch break and other employees don’t know what time they’ll be back! 👎🏻 …Horrible service. My mother went inside and the cashier was very rude to her. English is not her first language and this person should be more comprehensive towards non English speakers. The receipt says her name is “Tia”.Drove half an hour, wait for one hour - - only to be told ""system is down"" in the end - my second attempt to set up a new account at this branch - Wells Fargo is getting worse and worseOne of the bad branch I seen
The lady so rude and she has an argument with me and the manger can’t do anythingMuch Much better than the other onesThe worst service I've ever had in my life, the people who work there are not trained to serve customers, the bank had no money, it's ridiculous, the worst of the worst.
Most importantly, they are not interested in losing customers, they make fun of them and pretend they don't care.

409,Wells Fargo Bank,"17317 North Fwy, Houston, TX 77090",Houston,"Stopped by today in drive through to make a deposit and just wanted to say , the teller Terra had a great attitude and energy!Their personnel is just amazing!
I had to open my first account and was a bit stressed and anxious after some unfortunate experiences and Samekka went out of her way to help me, make me feel comfortable and make sure I understand everything she was explaining to me. She even shared one of her cereal bars because I mentioned I hadn’t eaten anything yet. She’s the best and I don’t care what advantages other banks might have but a customer service like this one is absolutely more important and reassuring.
Samekka thank you so much for your warmth service and your kindness you really made my day and I will definitely come to this location for everything I need just to see you!
Thanks!Very bad customer service. I just experienced racial profiling at this establishment by a teller called Annette. I went into the location attempting to cash a check. The entire time she was making faces she denied check just by saying oh you have to contact maker. I contacted the maker she mentioned that she herself has experienced racial discrimination. Fortunately, I went to another wellsfargo they cashed it with no problems.Wow can’t believe how long you have to wait in line at this bank. You’ll be waiting at least 30 minutes to see a bank teller.  Definitely don’t recommend coming to this Wells Fargo. There’s usually only 1-2 people working. They know this area is busy especially since the Wells Fargo closed inside of HEB across the street.I would give this location a zero. Felt so discriminated. The teller was so not professional. There is no charge for cashing a Wells Fargo check. Just called the 1800 number and the lady said it doesn’t matter if I have Chase, Woodforest no banks charge to cash there own checks. My mother in law asked me to take her to cash this check and all she had was her passport and visa and the teller had the nerve to say is this real. Really!!! Wells Fargo y’all need more help in professionalism and customer service!!!!!Worst bank experience ever every single time I come they are understaffed and always have to wait a long time. The manager tried to step in to help for deposits only when it’s the beginning of the month and people are trying to withdrawal. This location is on Westheimer and kirwood where is super busy one would think they would have plenty of staff specially for the beginning of the month. Even after they take your card and slip they still take over 15 minutes to withdrawal money.Worst bank ever.  Customer service is non existentTbh I’m not sure why this branch is here. They never have tellers. You make an appt and people are late. It’s such an inconvenience. So unacceptable! Close down!They don’t even know how to deposit a check. I got a different location I got no problemsI have a bad service they keep the people wait in the line and I wait for somebody to help me and I’ve been with Wells Fargo long time and we have a little issue and they told me just to wait for somebody’s gonna help you and I’ve been wait like an hour and a half nobody help and I love this location that I go to the other location services Macbeth even know that’s a horribleIs Kitty here?It’s horrible and zero customer service, This Location made me lose my mind I been waiting for 30 mins on line and I just left. I just don’t want to say a lot.Waiting for more than 40 minutes due to a conversation between the employee and the customer.  A conversation with friends, not about work

411,Wells Fargo Bank,"11105 Westheimer Rd Ste F, Houston, TX 77042",Houston,"Great customer service experience on Friday Aug. 11.

I live in Ohio, where there are no brick-and-mortar WF banks, so I take care of serious banking matters when I visit my family in Houston. On Friday, I went to the WF bank near San Felipe and Voss and was fortunate to have Indenishia as my teller. I thought I'd have to wait for a banker, but as there was no one else in line, she said she could help me. And that she did. She was friendly and she knew her stuff. I was out of there in about five minutes.

Customer service seems to be a dying art in this country, so I wanted to tell Indenishia (and her supervisors) how pleased I was with her service. Thanks again!!The best branch by far- always extremely helpful, communicative and kind.  Grateful to have found this gem!Ana is an invaluable asset to WF Bank.  She displayed the highest level of courtesy, politeness, decorum and professionalism in my brief interaction with her.  She is also welcoming, a keen listener and highly knowledgeable in her field of expertise.  It is my fervent hope that she is fully acknowledged and appreciated by upper management of WF for embodying the spirit of excellence.Absolutely horrible. I waited 45 minutes before i got tired and walked out. The teller told me to go sit down and wait. After that there was no indication on how long or when will i be seen. Either this branch needs to hire more people or just shut it down.Amazing bank, super trustworthy staff!Can’t wait to close thanks to Thuy 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 …","Positives:

I would recommend this Wells Fargo. He got me in and out with no problemsVery bad experience and this location. first time there and never again omg. Teller very unprofessional and very rude expression and very bad tone used. Was sitting the whole time like he  was sitting on  a recliner sofa or so. teller name is Alex.Worse service I have ever had. My teller AMY QUINTANILLA was very rude and made me very uncomfortable. I have banked with your company for years and this was my worse experience ever. The teller was so rude I wanted to close my account just so I would never have this experience again.I just deposited my check over there and I’m really not satisfied with their attitude. A lady took care of my deposit but as soon as I asked about replacing my card she even didn’t bother her self to answer me properly and asked me to call to costumer service for that! Well I was the costumer and I believe she is over there to giving service to me considering my issue. But unfortunately she didn’t. Plus the way that she was talking to me due to my question was vey rude and without even taking another look at me she called the next costumer. I probably close all of my accounts with this bank soon.don’t trust the banker .. told me he  set appointment next week .. i haven’t received confirmation so i called customer service they said you don’t have any appointmentNo bankers are ever present, no human communication over the phone... everything is automated with robots, which literally never answer my questions or resolve the issue im calling about. If you request ""speak to banker/representative"" you just stay on the phone ringing forever...because the bank has no bankers.

Customer service is literally 0.It has been a horrible experience with this bank from the beginning. I should have went with my first thought and canceled my account with them. This branch is unable to handle my banking needs and for some reason finds the need to chuckle at the banking problems I have with them over the phone. I’m not sure if every branch is like this, but steer clear of this one.Probably the second time i do a review in 35 years.     This is the WORST of the worst. There are really bad customer services in some places, but here they are the champions.This is the worst bank, tellers just keep cancelling appointments to get our money, Im thinking its a texas thing in how they work here!!!One of worst branches in houstonthe best wells fargo bank.. mrs nazly and mr jose was awesome thank you for helping me🙏🙏 …Very informative!Anyone know if this location is hiring?Great feedback & on-time.Very good job from Mrs. Monica, her desire to help is immense.

It took over 30 minutes and they never finished my change order. Then the lady assisting me said,” you have to remember you have three deposits.” I used to be a banker and teller, and I am positive each transaction should take no more than 3 to 5 minutes. No apologies, offered or explanations made.IF I COULD GIVE THIS LOCATION A ZERO I WOULD. This is truly the worst Wells Fargo in Houston I can never believe how LONG it takes to help someone. I’ve waited an hour in the drive through with only 1 person ahead of me and once I go inside they always have a line but yet only one person at the window helping.Lazy people working here drive through always close afternoon I go inside and talk to the Manager they open the drive through…..
When I go drive through for deposit they hold me 15 minutes and they are talki each other time passing inside….and talkingI like to say that on Saturday October 9,2023 @ 9:am
Me and my boss went to get change and the teller who works the drive thru window
Name is Elizabeth was the rude is young lady. Didn't give me a chance to ask her what I needed. People like her with an attitude should not be working in a bankMost of the people don’t know what they are doing they want to give you appointments because they don’t want to work  they are not profesionales lack of customer service they don’t dress professionally I though they were customersI don't really have to say much the ratings speak by itself I came to fulfill a requirement on a credit card application that asked me fax Wells Fargo a copy of my ID but this branch has some of the least knowledgeable CRS clerks I ended up going to 901 Gessner Rd and within 8 minutes they took care of my issue ..I Called to speak the manager and Mary or maribel whatever her name is. She was terribly rude and not understanding of my situation at all. I do not even bank with Wells Fargo I have BOA, but I had a Teller withdrawal fraud transaction at the branch. All she had to do was let me speak with the branch manager who would be more capable of handling a customer service situation as such with fraud and a police matter.They bank always closes 20-30 min before 5pm. You'll have to arrive by 4pm because at 4:15pm they close the doors and leave. Worst bank ever. Moreover,  they always have only 1 persons to help A-line of 20 people,  and the drive thru takes 35min to help 2 cars.🤦‍♂️ …My name is Takeshia sherard, yesterday I went to the ATM and deposited money $700.00 and it didn't credit my money so I went into the branch  and a rude teller just blew me off and told me to call a number on the back. I asked for the manager at the branch . She came out and had me do a claim
I was told the have no affiliation  with the Atm
I made it clear. I wasnt losing my money like that so someone better do something. I was told I needed to wait for the atm guy to come
This started at 938 am. I came came at 4
something  and sport to another manager  and an assistant district manager. While I'm waiting  the ATM  guy show up. I asked for a temporary  credit because  I needed  my money . I was told to wait a day and they would see what could be  done initially  the  manager  told me once the teller came it would get resolved  but that didn't happen .
The  customer  services manager told me it would take 5 to 10 day OMG, I ALMOST Passed out.  poor customer  ser east freeway  brach.Jessica was so nice, I don't regret switching to Wells Fargo BankingThis branch is always closed during regular business hours, I don’t understand why , if the other locations are open, seems like they only open when they feel like it . It’s been going on for about 3 months nowThey close before 5pmLazy, lazy, lazyWells fargo the worst bank in the United States and this one in particular the worst work staff and lousy attention I do not recommend it to anyone change banks at this address they are always late they never meet the schedule it does not workTerrible service. All the agents are on their computers and do not attend to the people in the lobby, as they are waiting for their appointments but in 20 minutes no one has arrived.
So they are not interested in helping those who need a service.The worst bank, don't go there, its staff is lousy, its agents seem to have not finished primary school, they don't know how to be friendly, much less professional, in my opinion they should close it or bring in new staffOne star says it all, even the security guard is terrible in every aspect, sitting/almost lying in the chair behind a desk and ignoring everyone who came in3.55 p.m. Closed Monday","Positives:

415,Wells Fargo Bank,"8607 Westheimer Rd, Houston, TX 77063",Houston,"Very Professional staff member answered my questions while I was waiting for my appointment, just a few questions I needed help understanding my request for a personal loan, she answered my questions very fast & professionally, very nice to me & so helpful, saved me time from waiting. I forget her name but I give her 5 star rating on her of how helpful she was towards me.Every time I come there only one teller, if you in rush don't waste your time. Wait time is normally 30mins to 1 hr.One of the ghettoest Wells Fargo ever, the atms never work and when they do it’s only one I hate coming here and will switch banks just for this reason.I’ve started using this branch since I moved to the area and never had any issues.This branch is so slow one person at the window on the inside after 3 been in line waiting on one person so for over 15min this is sad. If you have standing issues. Don't come here.Line out the door… just a normal day. Hire more people! Unacceptable. Also management writing feedback to everyone reporting on the same issue, stop saying you will fix it and do nothing about it, people been complaining about this for years at this locationI've given this branch several chances, and they continue to disappoint... I left Wells Fargo years ago in disgust, and am only dealing with them now because of an IRA inherited from my father and the ease of keeping it with them initially. I stopped in to talk to them about the paperwork, and the girl at the desk (who was hanging out with a friend, talking) told me that I need to go online and schedule an appointment to talk to someone - even though there was no one there seeking help at the time and people doing nothing. I did what I needed to do online. Today, I need to get one final document notarized, and I've called 5 times since they opened to see if they offer that service at this branch, only to have no one pick the phone up while the ""live"" Google update says ""not busy"". It's obvious that Wells Fargo has no appreciation for customers, their business, or their money when they allow customer service this bad to continue (I'm NOT the first to comment on how bad this location is). I wish I could leave a lower rating...  I'll be moving my accounts out of Wells Fargo again soon; I hear that Bank of America is much better to their customers...I can attest to this location and it’s horrendous customer service. I walked in for a simple wire transfer, mind you there was nobody else inside… I was told that I need to make an appointment and unfortunately there was only one banker who was not available at that time to help me.. I went down the street to another branch and was assisted immediately, no appointment needed. Avoid this location like the plague!!! This is not the first time I’ve had a problem either, don’t even waste your time in the drive thru, you’re better off driving somewhere else 10 miles away that can keep the line moving.I hate this Wells Fargo bank location.Everytime I come here there is always one window open and the bank full of people.Wells Fargo shows us that our time ain’t valuable .I only come here cuz of the way my landlord got their account set up or I wouldn’t bank here at all. I stopped banking with them in the early 2000s I’m propbably gonna move just to not deal with them anymoreAlways a long line!
Only 1 Teller behind the window most days!
Slow service and something's always wrong with 1 of the ATM's!
At least they're kind though, that's a plus!Customer service is horrible . When the IRS deposited my refund , I went here to withdraw 4 thousand . The teller straight up lied to me and said the funds wasn't available which I knew was a lie . I went to another branch after calling corporate to withdraw my money .Almost never anyone at the desks to help, even with an appointment booked over 24 hours in advance.I strongly recommend this bank the tellers are way more efficient than the tellers at Wells Fargo on Tidwell.Going to enroll for a account here.No bankers, wells fargo is a JOKE.Very bad service, the workers at the window are very slow, they don't know how to do their job....","Positives:
- Very professional staff member who was helpful and answered questions promptly.
- Kind customer service.

- Efficient tellers at a different bank.

Room for improvement:

- ATMs often not working or experiencing issues.
- Lack of response to customer complaints and recurring issues.

Miscellaneous:
- Some customers have had positive experiences with the branch and have not encountered any problems.
- Complaints and negative experiences have led some customers to consider switching banks.
- One customer is only using this branch due to a specific account setup with their landlord. Otherwise, they would not bank there."

The manager of this location is really kind, I also recommend the banker Tarita, she is so kind and has a great customer service.Female banker there right at this moment is extremely rude and nasty. Very unfortunate. When I called to speak to the manager on site this same teller said they were busy. This idiot won't be there in two months I garunteee itThe manager and the account opening do not understand how addresses work. Such a waste visiting hereLong time customer here! 15 years of banking with Wells Fargo so far and I've never had such a pleasing experience. My husband was opening a new account and wasn't looking forward to having to wait for a banker. Mrs.Tarita was available right away and took very good care of us, all while having a laugh with great conversation. We need more personal bankers like her that make the whole banking process much more tolerable.

417,Wells Fargo Bank,"5219 Richmond Ave., Houston, TX 77056",Houston,"I’m a WF customer that’s a regular here to get notaries done for work and find it extremely beneficial to just do them here as opposed to going to a notary place to pay an extra fee. Staff are also helpful and friendly including the bankers and the branch manager.DONT deposit money into their ATM!!!! I attempted to deposit $70 on March 5th.

One 20 dollar bill and one 50 dollar bill. ATM read the 20 dollar bill properly and then displayed this message after it didn’t read the 50 dollar bill.
And when I immediately called customer service the agent basically just says oh well, to file a claim and wait ten business days.

Unless you want to get your money eaten by their ATM don’t go to this location. Thanks Wells Fargo for taking food out of mine and my childrens’ mouth because your ATM is so jacked up!!!!! That’s just WRONG on so many levels. After tonight I am DONE with wells.I got the Best customer care service today from Odalys.She assisted me with opening new account.She was so calm,cheerful,friendly,hospitable and above all patient in answering all my questions.I wanna say Big Thanks to Odalys and the girl in the cashier forgot her name (curly hair) for the great customer service!I walked in to do a wire transfer and got assisted by Odalys. Odalys reviewed my situation and confirmed I was being scammed by someone online. She helped me out tremendously and saved me from losing any money. I couldn't be more thankful for her outstanding knowledge and professional skills. Please, to whoever is reading this, give Odalys much praise in the workplace! I was very happy with my experience, despite the scary situation, but Odalys gave me great reassurance.Thanks!The drive thru ATM access in this WF branch is most unusual. Unlike the normal anti clockwise access around the bank, this ATM access is clockwise! However , the customer teller helped me without having to go to the ATM.Made an appointment to open a bank account. The banker was very rude and reluctant to help. I felt she was in a hurry to leave and was unhappy that she had to help us. I am taking my business to another bank.I was just there today and actually just go off the phone with someone I didn’t get her name but just wanted to say yall have amazing staff , very respectful, ready to attend you, make you laugh. It can make someone’s day like it did to me. Thank you for what y’all do.Stood in the customer inside line forever while a bank employee stood and looked at me and sipped coffee without even muttering a word. Terrible service.This ATM is out of commission 50% of the time- makes having a Wells Fargo by my house useless.The customer service was working on Wed 12pm she is not nice.

418,Wells Fargo Bank,"3601 Eastex Fwy, Houston, TX 77026",Houston,"The customer service is the worst I ever had!, I arrived at 4 pm and at 5 pm was asked to leave because it closed at 5pm ,without serving me., this lady was so arrogant,  I am thinking of closing my two accounts I have with WELLS FARGO. If they tell you that it's late (4pm ) I leave with out problem, but after an hour of waiting is not fair.I have been told that to que online by the bank teller, Kay Kelly, and my number was number 3. After waiting about 5 minutes, there was another the white guy came and the teller told me that my number now is number 4, since that guy qued before me and they chitchat from my back.
Another 50 minutes I waited, there was another white guy came and then the teller told me that the guy have come and waited longer than me, so he will be served before me.
Lucky for them there is no option for “Zero Star”, because they don’t deserve half of a star for reviewing.
I decided to leave to another branch, since I waited for more than 1 hour and cannot solve anything.
Poor service and DiscriminationThe wait through the drive through is at least an hour when several employees are in the location but only one teller is working,  horrible wait time just to do a simple deposit, I can see staff just sitting on their desk doing nothing, chit chatting, not a care for everyone waiting,  this is a horrible location,  avoid this location,  they don't care to improve despite all the complaints and reviews.The ATM machine outside will STEAL your money. I put in 400$ to deposit but it only counts 350$. I take it out and retry, same thing (8 50$ bills). I go inside to deposit and tell them about the machine. They say because the machine is probably full of money. They do not seem to care. Beware when depositing money to it's ATMThis location will have 6-7 associates on staff but only 1 person working the front counter. I truly don’t understand why they can’t come together as a team and help get the line down in the front office.Horrible customer service and attitude. Extremely slow drive-thru for commercial services. I would go to the branch on Louetta. They don’t value your time here.Eyyy this my second time with this lady her name is diem Nguyen, she is the sweetest lady in there I love it, she very funny 😄 10/10 forsure thankyou Wells Fargo …Poor customer service at this location. They will sit around & talk but not worry about tending to their customer's needsThe worst customer service ever. you have to wait for a long time before you can get a service, then you still don't have anyone ask you if you need help. The manager passed by me twice  did not even look me in the eye to ask me what I was waiting for. We've been customers for over 35 years this is the worst location we have been toThe customer service here is terrible.  I went in and signed in for a simple checking account just so they could end up telling me they didn't have time for it cause they were closing (after sitting there for 40 mins).  If I was going to sit there for nothing, they should have told me as soon as walking in, there too many people ahead and you won't be serviced.  They were so rude.Great experience. Ms. Petra Thomas.  Helped me with my first wire transfer today. She was extremely patient with me.  She was very knowledgeable and even joked with me. Great experience thank you Ms. PetraATMs are most likely out of service. At least they are whenever needing cash or depositing a check/cash.Bad service. And there is only one person on duty to take care of customers in the lobbySlow serviceGreat bankPlease check the money and don't trust that they have put the money in the sealed envelope. Sep 16 I went to change some checks and I was $100 short when I opened the envelope I went to talk to the bank and they said they don't have cameras.Excellent good treatment and I was able to solve my problem since other banks did not want to help me highly recommended and very good treatment by Joe ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Don't Get an Account with them!!!

419,Wells Fargo Bank,"9715 Westheimer Rd, Houston, TX 77042",Houston,"This Wells Fargo branch has a few things going well and a few things that could be better.

What's working: immediately approached by staff, offered appointment versus waiting at the branch, very patient with the customers

What could be better: paperwork process (I had to leave and come back despite sending documents over via email), assistance for agents in the building (the help line for their staff is awful)

Overall, a decent visit.This is my 5th visit to this branch. I have been customer for 10 years. Horrible service all time!Wait in line with one teller. Other individuals at the branch but will not help the only workerI got the bad luck of the draw and came to this location on a Friday afternoon....first time here....only 1 bank teller available to attend 20+ customers standing in line. Something is wrong with staffing/management. With one of the most busiest timeframes of the day...1 teller is available. This experience is the first for me, saving this location in future to black list this place to make sure I dont make the same mistake to visit this Wells Fargo location again.Giving this location two star because, the mobile atm is the worst. It’s out of order almost once or twice a week it feels like. This makes it so inconvenient. And when you park to walk up to the atm located outside it’s out of order at times as well. Ghetto!!!I came but the store was already closed 20 mins early. What gives.

*Hey, thanks for replying back so quickly. I'll trying again today!They hardly want to work turning customers away when they have no one in their little cubicles talking about appointment only which doesn’t apply anymore they just use it as a way to not do anything corporate will be calledWorst location. ATM always out of cash..Don’t come to this bank the lady’s are so rude!Real bad serviceI always went to that bank and today it was time to close I told Mrs. Silvia let me come in my car broke down I would have arrived earlier she said no more people will come but another man told her let me come in she said it's fine I explained to her and she looked at me pregnant I walked with my son to get to the bank and even so he did not let me in because it was difficult for him to pass I felt so bad because I left him like him and he did not say I will not pass more people and that is the closest bank not to me I come back but I prefer to go to another my experience is zero stars 😡😡😡Customer service was excellent","Positives:

420,Wells Fargo Bank,"14001 Memorial Dr, Houston, TX 77079",Houston,"I'm sitting here with my 83 year old father. All I need to do is add myself to his account. There's one customer service representative. I asked. Fortunately we had NOTHING to do and no doctor's appointments to make at the time we came in because we were not acknowledged at all. Not once. I'm still waiting and we're at 45 mins and counting. I am not criticizing the job the representative is doing as we have been waiting this long... clearly thorough. I watched 3 people wait and leave in the time we have been sitting here.  UPDATE:  Now we're being told by a new representative that it was by appointment today and again no one told us. There's no signage to say by appointment or ""we're only doing appointments."" the 3 people that came and went also left not knowing things were by appointment only today. The least you can do is get the local community stuff in order. Fully happy to make an appointment if we had known when walking in. I'll give y'all an extra star because they're fitting us between appointments.We were at the bank to open the safe deposit box, after over  30 mins some lady comes from get office,  and told us they were to busy, that we need to make an appointment,  is the first time in over 20 years you are treated dispolite.
Really bad service at the longpoint and dirt location, it is a shameLeidy was amazing!! she helped me open my account & answered all my questions, I will definitely be coming back here.I had an issue with my account and received great customer service from Agustin. Thank you for your patience and resolving the issue I had with my account.The manager Leidy is knowledge and very helpful. She resolved my issue and I was on my way in no time!Long lines and only 2 tellers. Clear always has more tellers…could it be that Wells Fargo values its clear lake client’s time much more?The AtM never works, it's always broken, no good service wellsfargoNo more ATM at the front also you need a appointment to go inJust got this account and I already realize that I made a big mistake I shouldn't have made the change from chase to Wells Fargo bank lines or out the door long wait times inside and out this is a warning to all reading this.WOW.

421,Wells Fargo Bank,"6907 Farm to Market 1960 Rd W, Houston, TX 77069",Houston,"I’d give 0 if I could after my experience with mrs KAREN, literally her name. Glad you live up to it because she literally argued with me on everything I had to say and I could tell it’s because I’m young. I’m sure she made her assumptions about me, tried to talk down on me, gas light me telling me they don’t do money orders to certain places then just blatantly seem like she didn’t know how to spell what I was asking her to make it out to. She even asked if she could leave it blank. She counted 300$ and didn’t know how to subtract 150 from it either. Needless to say I was scared when she was asking me how to count and I’m suppose to trust this lady with my money..? have a great day Karen.I went to this location on Louetta in Vintage Park this morning to report fraud on my account. I walked in, and Deryck offered to help, I told him that my account account had been compromised and asked, what did I need to do. He simply replied, “all fraud is handled over the phone”…. I had a puzzled look at this point, like is this all I get???  I then said, well is there anything you can do here in the Branch??? And he stated again, “all fraud is handled over the phone”. I said  I did call and there was like an 8 minute Hold. Mind you, during this 8 minute Hold, more theft could be occurring on my account! So I said is this all you can do for a customer reporting fraud? So he stated again, basically fraud is handled over the phone. But then offered to look at my account. He pulled up my account, asked me what transactions I was reporting, looked at the 3 transactions (totaling $400) and stated yes, I see them but yet AGAIN, I’m sorry but fraud is handled over the phone, and went on to say, that was basically the only way to resolve my fraud issue. Then he went on to say that he could call the Fraud department with me, but he had a 10a.m. appointment that he could not miss nor be late for!!!!. And if he called, that would mean that he would too be on Hold waiting and therefore miss his 10a.m. appointment!!! I said this is really sad, that this is all the help I can get considering it is FRAUDULENT activity on my account. I mean, he didn’t offer to close my accounts, close card, put a Hold on my account, or ANYTHING!! He offered no type of assistance to me on this matter other than, CALL THE FRAUD DEPARTMENT, ALL FRAUD IS HANDLED OVER THE PHONE. So I walked out and had to basically gather my thoughts, calm myself down and call and wait on Hold, praying that more fraud is not being done on my account while I’m Holding!!! His Customer service, empathy and personal banking ethics were not available to me at all on this matter!!! And it was such a let down!!!!I put money into the atm and it didn’t give back 20$ Im missing 20! it took it as a check but I didn’t give it back !!Rita the teller is incompetent, a liar and She stole my work character “distraction” badge for the pediatric kids I see daily.
I went in on a Friday to activate my new card. I received an urgent phone call while waiting for the above mentioned teller to finish with the customer before me. I stepped to the window to take my call and my work badge broke from my lanyard - I thought I caught all my badges from my lanyard but I didn’t. After my call I went to Rita to activate my card (so I thought). I went back to work and noticed my character badge was missing and I remembered it fumbled while I was at WF.  Over the weekend I tried to use my debit card that Rita was supposed to activate - it was declined. I called customer service and they said the card wasn’t activated. I explained to customer service that I went into a branch direct to activate my card but I would return to that location Monday to activate the card and retrieve my work badge.
I went back to WF louetta/249 to the same teller that helped me Friday. first, I asked for my character badge and before I could even finish asking for my badge, “Rita” interrupted and said “we don’t have it” - almost like a guilty child that knows they’ve been caught. I said ma’am that is a distraction/soothing  character badge for pediatrics. “We don’t have it”. ...(how would she know if she didn’t look in lost and found or ask anyone else — oh, maybe it’s because she had it). Her face, words and actions ratted her out.  I let her know my debit card was declined over the weekend because it hadn’t been activated. She asked for my card and proceeded to tell me that I needed to call the number on the back of the card to activate it. WHAT!  I asked why she didn’t tell me that the Friday before? No response. I let her know that I had lost  confidence  in her teller skills and left.
I immediately called to speak to the branch mngr, Kristen - she was out so I left a vmail directly on her phone. I called again the next day to find out Kristen would not be back until the following Tuesday. I waited for Kristen to return my call - by Wednesday I finally called her and explained what had happened at her location.  After she listened and took notes and asked to call me back to give her time to discuss the situation with her teller.

The next day Per Kristen, ... “Rita” “misunderstood” initially  that I wanted to activate my card... AND she “misunderstood” the second time when I returned Monday to activate my debit card AGAIN and get my badge.
C’mon Kristen, I know you are smarter than to believe this BS! Taking up for her employee is one thing but to defend a bold face lie....wow!  Kristen you have been made a fool of.  Kristen apologized that I didn’t get the outcome I wanted. I never asked for an outcome. I was making Keistentaware of the kind of employee Rita is ....a lying thief. Rita’s actions will not make me or break me. Rita is WF’s problem and liability not mine.  I’ve been your customer since 1991 - but  this is by far the worst.
The only good thing from this exchange, I was able to stop a wire transfer from a title company before it was released to WF.Omg! Rita thanks for processing my transaction one minute before you closed. It was a Christmas game changer! I would love to thank the gal at the door for letting me in but didn't catch her name.NEEDS NEGITIVE STARS!!!!!   DON'T GO TO THIS LOCATION!!!! I WAS FOLLOWED, CAR BROKEN IN AND ROBBED!

422,Wells Fargo Bank,"4888 W Bellfort Blvd, Houston, TX 77035",Houston,"The take a really long time it’s Friday n they only had one cashier working. Was going to open an account for my daughter. There was a chunky Hispanic lady who was rude n asked me what I was here for and I told her what for because I was already waiting for them to be seen. Then I said I was waiting for a while then she said oh you weren’t waiting that long. Like if she really knew how long I was waiting for. Never opening an account at that location people there are rude this was the second time I go there and now I’m leaving a review of how dissatisfied I really am about this location with rude people. Every the one lady working at the drive was rude maybe because of the area it’s located.This is where people get robbed . And the bank employees won’t help you catching the robber. One of my friends was robbed right outside the bank and the guy followed my friend from inside the bank . we went to ask them to show us the cameras but the bank employees didn’t want to show us the cameras. And they close early they said it’s 12 o clock but they close the doors at 11 am on Saturday. What a poor service . Never coming back here and would never recommend anyone else to bank at this location. You need a security guy with all the crazy people hanging around the bank. The bank should take care of their customers. DON’T BANK HERE , SAVE YOUR LIVES AND MONEY!!!!I went into the branch today to cash a check…the teller was extremely nice but I informed her that I had come from the dps office and they’d kept my id and gave me my license. The teller says she’s pretty sure she can cash my check but she needs to speak with her manager. The manager comes out on an extreme high condescending horse and says they don’t take paper ids even though the website says they do. He even called security on me even though I never threatened him or anything. I ended up calling the corporate number and they told me that I could cash a check with a temporary id as long as it has my picture on it(it does). I ended up going to another branch and cashing it even explaining what I went through with her. She says how I was treated was unacceptable and she’s filing a complaint also.I have been a loyal wells fargo customer for over 15 years and the manager ( l assumed)  a latino woman, short  kind of chubby was very unprofessional with no respect for a customer in need.
She kinda was stressed (I guess) that she just told me to wait 30 minutes or come back later... as I was trying to explain my situation she ask me to leave, there was no people in line....I made a deposit and left....please CEO don't waste your money on this kind of people.
Wells fargo location at gessner and south Braeswood.
SHE'S NOT FIT FOR THAT VERY PROFESSIONAL POSITION!!!I wanted to set up a business acct. I had an appointment and I sat there for 30 min. before anyone ask me for help. I spent another hour with the lady, she was clueless as to what to do. I ended up wasting 1 hour and 30 min and nothing as accomplished. I took my documents and leftWent to this branch because someone stole my wallet and they allowed that person to come into the branch with my drivers license and cash three stolen checks. When I explained to the branch manager what happened she couldn’t help me because I had no valid Texas drivers license to prove who I was. I filed several claims and still nothing has been done. I’m going to the BBB to file a complaint on this branch and the workers.Very bad drive way was open but manager doesn't want to take deposits for business account.  Inside only 1 window open. It's was horrible service .This branch is full of people with horrible attitudes and the tellers act like they have a nasty chip on their shoulders. I don't recommend.Horrible!

I asked for one box of pennies and apparently all they can spare is 10 rolls. What a joke. What a bank. Well done guys. Keep it going, you guys have potential of summing 1 star for this location!This Wells Fargo Bank has always been welcoming. Their staff has been always courteous and helpful.  Busy times that I have been there seems to be noon time and after 3 pm.

If you need to buy foreign money for business trip or vacation, you need to come into the bank and order them 2-3 days ahead. Banks no longer hold onto foreign currency.

Domestic wires take about 3-5 hours if you do it in the morning or the next day if you send it in the afternoon. International wires take 2-3 weeks.

There are ATMs in front of the bank and inside the bank.

It has a decent amount of parking space. This bank has all that you need. It’s a good bank.Can't deposit cash in mom and dad's acct...same last name acct number and routing number...have done it before..needless to say my folks are changing banksThe Tellers at this location have great customer service skills, they are fast and friendly. However the management is stiff and rude. In particular the floor manager ( tall white guy) he doesn't speak to customers and I have witnessed him on several occasions be rude to staff. You all already do not have a good reputation work on your management's people skills.Employee came out to the parking lot while i was waiting on someone and told me to move my car since the lot was full when in reality there was a lot of parking spots available, never coming to this location again.This branch floor staffs are rude. They just don't want to work. Never go to this location.Lilibeth she is #1 banker have a seen before
Perfect customer services and passionThey really know what they're doing they took care of me in record time thank you so very muchGreat costumer service always willing to help 👍 …","Positives:

426,Wells Fargo Bank,"13560 I-10, Houston, TX 77015",Houston,"Opened up AC with this location lady name ADRIANA who helped us out. I would say best customer service. I highly recommend her for personal banker. She is super professional who knows how to treat customer.Amazing customer services I am delighted to see nothing has changed in the states when it comes to customer service.not sure about week days but stay away from a saturday
and make sure you book an appointment before you go there
employees talk more about personal life than actually work.

than someone walks up to you just to tell you that you were just
on the waiting list and you will probably need to wait another hour and there is a big chance that they will not get to see you.We've been seated here for about 30 minutes and the personal bankers are not calling anyone up? I see one of them is busy with a client, but there is one seated in his office while there still 3 people waiting for help and the other one is in queue chatting with a customer. How is this even allowed? Wells Fargo service is mediocre at best, but this is bad!!!!Terrible customer services.. The relationship team Is not bothered!

Went there at to open an account. Was told that there is a prior appointment at 9:30 am and i had to wait in case the person who has the appointment shows up. Kept waiting till 9:45, during that time the lady on the counter was busy using her phone and showing pictures to her colleague and laughing around. Eventually I left as i did not want to waste more timeSeating on the drive through 9:00 am. Is 9:15 still seating waiting for help. Signs off employees inside not even attempting to help. And by the time they finally asked me if I need any help. Was so rude and unprofessional.Thanks you so much for the great experience. Ara Hunt is definitely the best banker ever that can assist you with anything you need, she is professional and knowledgeable.They cancel your bank appointments! I scheduled an appointment and waited just for them to tell me somehow that I cancelled when I even showed my email confirmation. The bankers didn’t even try to help, the lady who spoke to us was rude and very unprofessional.Soooooo slow!!! Just needed a notary and the wait is ridiculous!!Most than excellent service .Espeacilally the handsome employee his name is Rafael , he helped me to manage my checking account  .He was so patient with me while he was teaching me how to do that. I thank him so much🌸 …It's a worse bank branch, and it will be a reason to cancel my business with them15 min wait for a simple deposit. With one person in front of me….Be careful with the drive thru atm yesterday I went to deposit money and he did not read me all the bills, I returned all the bills and he kept half, he did not return the restRafael, it was the worst customer service everThe cashier is bad costumer service her name is MichaelReally bad serviceBad service. I wanted to open an account for the first time and on the day of the appointment they did not want to open it for me, having previously consulted my requirements by phone. They made me waste my time.If you want a quality service and in Spanish, ask for Ariadna, she works quickly and is very attentive.More than an hour to serve you and without people online 😒","Positives:
- The customer service from a lady named Adriana was highly recommended and considered the best by one reviewer.
- The text mentions an employee named Ara Hunt who is described as the best banker and very professional and knowledgeable.
- The bank branch offers service in Spanish, and one reviewer recommends asking for a banker named Ariadna for quick and attentive service.

Room for Improvement:
- The bank branch needs to improve its appointment system as one reviewer mentioned that appointments were canceled without their consent and the bankers were not helpful or professional in addressing the issue.
- There are complaints about long wait times and unprofessional behavior from employees, such as using personal phones, chatting with customers instead of assisting waiting customers, and talking about personal lives instead of focusing on work.
- The branch is advised to avoid overcrowding on Saturdays and encourage customers to book appointments before visiting.

Miscellaneous:
- One reviewer had a positive experience with an employee named Rafael who helped them with managing their checking account and was patient and helpful.
- There are complaints about slow service, rude behavior, and bad customer service from specific employees, but their names are not mentioned."
427,Wells Fargo Bank,"9577 Jones Rd #115, Houston, TX 77065",Houston,"Came in to open a youth account for my teen - to teach her the importance of banking, etc...only to be turned away because they were going to close in 35min...and it ""could"" take ""up to"" 45min to accomplish the task. There was not a single other customer in there too...just obviously didn't want to work. Went to another WF branch today and they didn't want to see us without an appointment. You would think I was trying to get a small business loan...this is a simple checking account for a child. After 30+ years with Wells Fargo, I think I'm getting the hint: They don't want my business. They don't want my kids' business. I was a little slow to get it...but I get it now. Message received. I will certainly take another bank up on their constant invites to switch banks...AND receive a nice bonus for doing so.No drive thru ATM and the ATM in front of the building is out of order. Worthless.If there was a minus stars, that is what I would give to  this bank.  Waited over 10 minutes in the drive through because there was only 1 teller.  No one came to help for 8 of those minutes.  Then when I got the cash from the check that I cashed, the bills were all sorts of different ways.  What happened to the days when you got all the bills facing the same way?  Heba you need some training.

Things have not changed at this branch.  I just hate going there, but it is convenient.  News Flash:  If I am in the drive through, I don't want you, the teller, to interrogate me about talking to someone about investing.  I am in the drive through, so I am in a hurry.  However, at this branch, there is no such thing as hurry.  Takes forever to get a transaction completed.  Also, my cash is NEVER turned in the same direction with the bills facing in the same direction.  It is a mess.  So if you can't do that right, then I probably know more about investing than anyone at your branch!  Tirade over........until next time.Horrible service, every time I have to come here I'm given the run around when trying to cash a check. My employer uses WF so I'm forced to deal with this company. I refuse to bank with them after having to join the class action against them years ago. Because I'm not a customer they always give me a hard time. If you need a check cashed and you aren't a customer you're better off just going to any nearby gas station that has Western Union.I have been coming to this location since last 10 yrs and i have never come across with such a bad customer service… for the safe deposite box they usually come upto you and ask you but recently i have come here twice and no one is even bothered to help you!! They are just busy with their work!!I visited bank on the August 3rd.to get in to my Safety Deposit box that I have been leased since 09/12/2005.to get my important document.Banker told me I am no longer have Safe Deposit Box and do not know where are those my belongings.Told me to  wait for 10 days.I am hoping for Branch manager or Regional manager could help me to find my very important papers please.The worse bank location,  We been deposit for years at this location now is been like a month that the service I really bad and the wait is worse  36 mi. To do a deposit and just that for today others days are the same , now I going to do the deposit on  the bank on Jones and west rd I go back and forth in lest that 15 minThat one time I pulled out 8000$ in 20$ bills just cause well I don't like you and your atm ran out of $Nice and fast bank!

Yesterday, I was on the phone with the home equity customer service for more than 1 hour, trying to get a letter ASAP, but Wells Fargo couldn't directly email customers. Time sensitive, Sean Ellis (was very professional and friendly) asked me to go to this office to have some one call him and print out my letter. I had begged Vy Vo to call, but she told me she was busy and also didn't let the 3 other tellers call. They were hanging around without any customers. I wonder how she can be a customer service manager.Worst service ever this people is something else everyone starting with the manager wooow!!

I went twice to bother her with some paperwork and both times She assisted me  with a positive vibe and kind  .Wellfargo is not the bank for your mortgage they will do anything they can to make it hard for you to pay your mortgage off. They use to offer escrow shortage payments to lower your monthly rate than about 4 years ago stopped it. AS I SAID BEWARELazy people. Refuse to do business. Want you to do everything online and make an appointment while they're not busy and sit there doing absolutely nothing. No social skills whatsoever. I see now why they have the reputation they have. 100% truth.

Sad this could never happen in a white community.This is the WORST banking experience I’ve ever had. We were unable to get the simplest task handled and after waiting over 45 minutes we were told that the only rep that could assist us would be tied up for another 1 1/2 hours. We asked in the beginning how long the wait was and we were told a few minutes and there were no other customers ahead of us. The only rep who could help us was busy conversating the entire time we were there and the conversation was clearly not about business. So unprofessional and a true waste of time. I closed my account that day as they are clueless to how customer service should be. If you value your time and money, please take your business somewhere else.I have that Wells Fargo branch near of my job ,  EVERYTIME y go there to deposit cash or checks  I have to leave ;  waiting time to deposit money 35 , 40 minutes  and probably more .

I DON'T RECOMMEND THAT PLACE . !!!    SERVICE IS THE WORSE I EVER HAVE SEEN IN MY LIFE .      DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME . . . .If i could give this location a negative star i definitely would. The bankers are rude. One banker ( male ) was very rude for no reason & the other banker ( lady ) was on her cell phone and just as rude. Neither one of the bankers were listening to anything i was asking of them. I would never recommend this location to ANYONE ! They definitely don’t like there jobs and are only there to collect a check. The lady didn’t even go over any disclosures with me.James B. Branch manager provided very poor management skills. When questioned how long was the wait for a simple notary service he pretended to be busy and never followed up. I waited for 30 minutes and then was told by another employee that the wait would be another 20-30 minutes.

434,Wells Fargo Bank,"13106 Woodforest Blvd, Houston, TX 77015",Houston,"Needed change for office. Went to the commercial drive thru window. Cars stacked 5 deep in front and a few behind me. After not moving for 15 minutes (have  no clue what the guy in commercial van at the window was doing that was so complicated but he was holding up the line). No other cars were in lanes for non-commercial so god only knows what the tellers were doing. I decided to head 10 miles out of my way and go to the Pasadena branch. This branch seems to be woefully understaffed. HIRE SOME EMPLOYEES. People are looking for work. Seems like when I go they have one person doing the drive thru and even the times I've gone inside they may have one or two people lackadaisically working the inside with lots more just milling around behind the counter avoiding eye contact with customers glaring, fidgeting and sighing in frustration. I work in customer service and this would not fly in my office.I sent wire transfer by customer service inside the bank,
After 2hr they surprise me by cancel wire transfer because the lady forgot to get my sign on paper.

I don’t know if she know her duties or I have to remind her what to do.Bank does not handle well. I rather travel 10 extra minutes to avoid coming here to wait in horrible long lines and look at the employees with their disgusted faces as I wait. Trust me, I dont want to be here during my day off! I came to get a loan twice. Received nothing but negative comments on getting one both times.

I also came to deposit money (different day )and did not want to stay outside in the cold. The manager asked me to do it at the atm. I said I had a lot of money... she looked at the rolls of cash in my hand and said it wasn't a lot of money. Very rude.Stupid a%$ bank they said they couldn't and wouldn't cash my Wells Fargo check for 250$ they wanted me to deposit it which didn't make sense at all don't bank with Wells FargoIf I could leave no stars I would. I came as a walk in to open a account and put myself on the waitlist and was second in line. After 30 minutes of waiting I was told that if I wanted to wait another 15 minutes that I could be seen if the appointment didn’t show up. Lady disappeared for 20 minutes. Finally came out and said she would be with me in just one second. Never happened!! They sat people who I’m assuming had appointments which ok I understand I was a walk in but why lie and tell me that if within 15 minutes the appointment doesn’t show up then I will be see. Finally saw the manager and asked her how much longer I’d be waiting since I had been there for an hour already. She straight up told me that I’d be waiting there until an appointment doesn’t show up. When I told her I did and still was not seen she told me to just apply online because they would be closing at 5 and I probably wouldn’t be seen. What’s the point of having a walk in option and letting people add themselves to the waitlist if you don’t have the staff to attend them!!! She brushed me aside and pretty much told me oh well have a good day and walked off. Hope she gets fired what a terrible managerHorribly understaffed. Always lines that don't move. No drive thru ATM, just walk ups and it's a very sketchy area. Just doing a commercial deposit is an ordeal.This location is very unprofessional and not trusting. DO NOT COME HERE. PLEASE. HASSLE HASSLE AND SOME MORE HASSLE. UNEDUCATED EMPLOYEES. THEY ALSO NEVER ANSWER THE PHONE.This place is a terrible excuse for a financial facility.  Took my dad in to speak about a loan. Had to wait 20 minutes in line just to let them know he was here.  Staffing is terrible.  One teller, one loan officer, one drive thru personal.  Should be embarrassed at this level of careSTAY AWAY FROM THIS BRANCH!! Sat in the drive thru for 10 MINUTES, asked if there was a problem, was told by the rude employee who clearly didn't want to be there that I just had to wait my turn, even though 2 cars in other lanes who arrived after I did had already come and gone. Finally just went inside to get my ID and card back, was told I would have to wait in a long line if I wanted to speak to the manager. Uh, no thanks, you've already wasted too much of my time. Will never return here!!Bad customer service ever received from a bank. Atleast 8 people in-line waiting to be served by 1 teller and they atleast 15 minutes with 1 individual. Someone please do something about this !No atm at allContinual problems with poor management at this location.

435,Wells Fargo Bank,"14600 Katy Fwy, Houston, TX 77079",Houston,"Everyone is very rude they are not professional at all. They don’t want to help with anything. This was not the first time they have been like this but this time was the last straw. First I went there to see if I could get a credit card but the lady “helping” me didn’t even fill an aplicación she just said that I couldn’t apply for one. I went to another location because the lady didn’t give me no information or even looked in my account she just refused to help me. In the other location they did help me and I was able to get a credit card and where able to help with everything and where able to give me information.The manager is very unprofessional and rude. I went to get a cash check . They told me I had to deposit the money first to be able to make one but then they told me I had to deposit it to another  account but when I told them that I have it differently that they should have told me that I need to deposit it in another account beforehand the manager told me she did but she clearly didn’t because someone else was helping me first . I told her that I have never had problems making a cash check and she told me that if I didn’t like the service I could to another location and that she didn’t want to see me there again. I went to another location where I didn’t even have to deposit any money they were every kind and helpful they gave me the cash check right away without any problems. unlike this location I do not recommend anyone coming here because it is the worst service ever. This is not the first time I had problems with them it’s been like 5 times I had problems but I continue to go there because it is the closest location to me but even if I have to spend more gas I will never go back to this locationI have been a customer for over 6 years, is so unfortunate and sad that the trees were chopped off.
All the branches , Unnecessary.
I am still asking why ?
Did they commit such crime against the trees.
Considering closing my account.Worst customer service ever. I have been to multiple Wells fargo places and I have been using this bank for more than 10 years. Never a teller and a lady seemed to be a manager on duty yelling at my face ever just because I asked for new cash to bring to other country. I did not even finish my sentence and both ladies yelled at me saying they didnt have new cash. My intention was to ask for cash that didnt look as damage. I was embarrassed because there was a line behind me. I had to go to the ATM and withdraw money and try to sort the cash out myself. This is what you guys call customer service? I go to Chase or BOA instead. Also, this teller lady almost lost my cash when I deposit my money by not checking the envelop I gave her. I asked her this is not the amount I deposit. She threw the envelop at me and my cash felt out. I told her if I would not ask I would have lost my money. She said she's only human without apologizing. Very upseting!This is a fancy multi-story Wells Fargo building, yet they struggle with basic communication and services. I came in for a notary and they expected me to jump through hoops even just to sign up and talk to a person. Their policies include treating customers differently based on technology access and dis/ability. Long wait time despite low volume of customers. Lots of delays and passive aggressive excuses as to why only 1 person, supposedly the only banker in the entire building, is capable of doing notaries (and how they're conveniently not available). Never had this problem with tiny branches before, and do not appreciate having nearly an hour of my day wasted only for them to tell me they can't do it.Troyette is the absolute worst!!! Very nasty and unprofessional.  Although it appears all branches are limited with Bankers, Troyette is obviously tired of picking up the slack and doesn't care to help in any way possible. Troyette has the ""it's not my job/problem"" attitude.  Times are hard enough for everyone and I do understand that our economy is in trouble, with shortages everywhere,  however, Tellers like Troyette will force my hand to close my Wells Fargo accounts and spread the word to others to NEVER do business with them. DO BETTER TROYETTE.Ive been banking with wells for a long time and never had a problem with because ive never asked for any service from a particular branch.  For the last 2 days ive walked in to 3 wells fargo branches and have been denied customer service in all 3 for a SIMPLE wire transfer.  This particular branchs excuse was that there is not enough ""bankers"".  This was from a guy just walking around the cubicles managing the non-existent traffic.  Not sure what position he holds but it shouldnt have been that difficult to wire money for a customer. Instead he told me to go back to the teller and get a money order because thats what my transaction needed.  I NEEDED A WIRE SINCE THE DAY BEFORE!!   I guess covid has also cut the customer service in businesses today along with the desire to work. Horrible experience and customer service.Horrible, the banker is talking about book an appointment, but they're booked all the until early March. What kind of service is this? All I was trying to do is open an account that possible take 20 minutes. There was literally no one in the bank when I arrived.Not enough bakers available,if you didn’t had an appointment you must wait,add your self to the waiting list but there’s no guarantee you get to see a banker,if no luck by the end of their  operating hours,you must return the next business day !Byron Flowers helped me out of a tight spot in getting the documents I needed. Byron put the “serve” in “service”! Thank you, Sir!!The worst service of my life. I signed up for the waiting list 1 hour later (3:20) someone comes out to tell me that they don't have time to see me because they have an appointment at 4 that I can do my process online it would only take 2 minutes at my house, I explained to them that I couldn't do it online and they asked me to go to the branch for someone to help me and they said they couldn't do anything...Terrible service, if I could I wouldn't give a star. Apart from the fact that they take you in the end, they cannot help you with what you need. I will never go back there. take the time to make an appointment and so that in the end it takes 45 minutes and they do nothing. I came out the same aah noo I came out with wasted time…Great WHEN I WAS IN HOUSTON TEXAS THERE I HAD MY ACCOUNT I NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH THEM IT WAS ONLY ONCE THEY CHARGED ME FOR SOMETHING THAT I HAD NOT AUTHORIZED BUT THEY GAVE ME MY MONEY BACK THANK YOU TEXAS EL CAMINO REAL LA NASSA","Positives:

437,Wells Fargo Bank,"10009 Almeda Genoa Rd, Houston, TX 77075",Houston,"Dear Sir/Madam,
I am writing to express my deep disappointment with the recent service I received at your bellaire branch in city of Bellaire. On 16th of Oct., I visited your branch to initiate an important wire transfer, and the experience I encountered was nothing short of frustrating and unprofessional.

Firstly, When I explained the urgency of my wire transfer, the representative assured me that they would expedite the process. However, to my disbelief, the wire transfer was not approved by the branch manager, despite the urgency and accuracy of the information provided. This delay caused significant inconvenience and financial stress.
Furthermore, my relationship manager have sent multiple important emails to the branch manager and other staff members regarding this issue, but I have not received any response to date. It is concerning that my attempts to seek clarification and resolution have been ignored.

Additionally, my attempts to contact the branch via phone many times have been met with long wait times and unresponsiveness. It is disheartening to experience such a lack of communication and assistance when dealing with critical financial matters.

I have been a loyal Wells Fargo customer for more than 10 years, and this experience has shaken my confidence in your bank's commitment to customer service. I had expected better from a reputable institution like Wells Fargo.

I urge you to investigate this matter promptly, expedite the approval of my wire transfer, and ensure that your branch's communication and customer service processes are improved to prevent such issues from occurring in the future.

I look forward to a swift resolution to this matter and an improvement in the quality of service that Wells Fargo is known for.

Sincerely,Went in  today my mother wanted to an account fist thing they guy in the office with wearing said ""YOU HAVE AN APPOINTMENT "" he said all his bankers were on vacation. He didn't even offer to help the bank was empty. NO CUSTOMERS! I been with Wells Fargo for years. We went next door to chase as soon we enter we felted  welcome we open her account. THE MANAGER NEEDS CUSTOMER SERVICE TRAINING. .I dont like to give 1 star reviews, but this is just a really bad location. They make you feel not welcome here. The very first question they ask when they see you is not ""good morning, how are you"" The first question is ""do you have an appointment"".
This has become a habit for all Wells fargo branches. I also have an account with Chase and Bank of America and they do not treat you like you are some useless time waste person.I missed her name but she is an older white lady not that old . Horrible attitude, she is so rude all i wanted was to deposit some checks in to my account i guess because I didn’t have “2 forms of identification” my visit was denied which i can understand since i only had my ID the thing is I don’t have my card i wanted to order one and wanted to ask how how to but she didn’t even let me, I don’t know what she was mad about or what is bothering her in her life but i went in with a positive attitude i always do i know how it is to work for customer service i get that we do get frustrated at times but taking it out on your customers it’s never the answer. We are all human beings just like you have feelings i do too, my mood was killed I don’t ever leave reviews because i find that being ignorant but I honestly did get bothered at the fact that she didn’t even let me ask the questions I had about my account. I went to the bissonnet wells fargo location. The vibes was totally different as soon as you walk in you feel welcome, they greet you with a smile and welcome you in. The ladies in the front assisted me with no problem i was able to check my checks with out any problems…They are very polite here, but I'm sorry for 1 star review. I was denied for a simple notary service, because the lady there ""was about"" to step out for lunch. It could only take her less than 3 min work, instead of telling customer to comeback 30 min after her lunch, or spend ""only"" $8 at the UPS store. It's her right to deny a customer since it's her lunch time, so i have mine to rate this store 1 starAfter being a loyal customer for 20+years I can't believe I was denied for a simple notary service.... the person even extended that no employee of Wells Fargo can help me. This used to be a great branch with great customer service, not anymore!I called earlier today to report terrible customer service and I was told a name that wasn’t heard properly, but after a THIRD visit I got the name. Her name is LINA. The first visit (yesterday) she gave the same attitude to my husband; the second visit (today) she gave the same attitude to my brother). On the third visit (today) my husband said she saw him & she rolled her eyes upon seeing him enter and sighed of annoyance. Amy helped him and gave him information that we didn’t receive because Lina wasn’t helpful; when my husband mentioned what Lina told him, she did not take accountability for her misinformation and said, “I didn’t tell him that.” She needs to take a class on how to treat her customers. If you have a bad day or a personal issue is affecting your job, KEEP YOUR ATTITUDE TO YOURSELF and stop taking out on other people. Again, Lina has terrible customer services, made the experience terrible, and ruined two days in a row.DO NOT USE the ATM here!!! It will not give you the correct amount and it will not count your deposits correctly! And when asking for help from the employees inside the branch THEY WILL NOT help stating its not their department! The atm belongs to the bank how are they not able to help with that??

The location is extremely slow and understaffed. There is literally ONE teller working inside. According to Branch manager, John Poates, this is a common practice - despite how many (or how long) customers are waiting. Although John had ample staff he refused to open additional windows. Customers waited over 20mins for assistance. MGR, JOHN POATES DOES NOT VALUE CUSTOMERS’ TIME NOR BUSINESS.

Avoid this location.Stop in here to get change. Horrible customer service. Only one teller inside bank, while line is backed up. Refuse to give change for a $100. Said I need to have an account in order to make change. What kind of extortion is that! You guys encourage me to never do business with you allReview completed by Linda Bedford.
Wow! Gone are the days of entering this bank and actually getting efficient customer service! I have lived nearby for years and always banked here, but this is ridiculous! I arrived at 10:30 this morning simply to get a quick document notarized. Nope. One couple waiting for a similar such transaction. Now there is a posted QR code in the lobby to get on a wait list. I have a smart phone and know how to use it, but the captcha didn’t work on this site and I couldn’t complete the “wait your turn” registration. I got in line for the teller, who helped me complete it and she explained there was one banker in the building. After 30 minutes of waiting, the one banker appeared to explain that he had someone coming in for an appointment, so it would be awhile before the other couple might be seen. Then, he had another appointment scheduled a short while after that. Enough said. I left the bank thinking that I need to do some investigation on a bank that actually staffs its branches to allow customers to take care of business.Always wait for an extended period of time just to make simple transactions. One teller and One drive thru attendant. Hire some more people!!!! This will be the last time I come to this branch. do yourself a favor and go to another branch!Banker makes appointment, confirms, and then cxls. Does he really want our business? Chase starting to look pretty good!5 teller windows. 1 teller working. 10 people in line. They can’t even do the math. 👎🏼
Find another bank with better service. …Maria the bank teller was very rude to the first 3 ppl that were in front of me. Then when it was my turn she gave attitude because the card reader was not working. Then proceeded to turn around and speak Spanish to one of her coworkers I’m pretty assuming I did not speak Spanish. Just very unprofessional and I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years.I have been dealing with Wells Fargo bank  for many years but I m giving 5 stars at this location because of Joselyn ,,  she is very professional fast quick ever and best customer service ever…she deserves to get  promoted…Would close account and never do business with Wells Fargo again if it wasn’t for Ms.Ericka skinner(5 stars to her)  everyone else is very unaccommodating.My first visit to this location.  Ms. Skinner is an outstanding listener and very interactive. Great customer service.It doesn’t matter what time of day you go to this location there will never be more than one teller inside and one teller for drive through so expect a 30-45 min wait.They say you could open an joint account online,NOT TRUE!!Only on person in the front. Bad serviceThe bank is closed for no reason and my card chip never works anywhere. I wanted to walk in the bank to withdrawal all of my money and close my account because I can never get good customer service here.This bank is 🗑 had me sitting there for 45 minutes to let me know you need appointment to see a banker …Bad service in that location i waited one hour and half 😫 to get a cashier check …Horrible customer service.Terrible locationVery bad attention","Positives:

We have 3 business  and 5 personal accounts with Chase but I promise you by the end of this month they'll be closed. This is the last time I'll go to this horrible disgusting bank.To whom it concerns there is an employee name Amber she always make us wait for long even there is no cars on front of us and when we call she answer on the speaker rudely loud WHAT she told us if we dont like it we can leave i told my husband we have to change bank to wellsfargo bank its just down the street this employee always have an attitude we dont ask for nothing for free we take our money to deposit not tfor her to be mad she looks like she dont like her job now we understand we dont see too many customers here its because of herVery slow service. When we asked for help, they told us to just sit and wait. It took 40 minutes for someone to look up and help us. They don’t have anyone managing the flow of customers in, just the teller at the window. The rest is a free for all.I went to this bank to withdraw a big amount of money, when i left i had my money well hiden, i drove to memorial city mall i seen a white car chasing me but didn't pay attention, 3min after i after i got off my car my car gps sent me a disturbance notification to my phone but i didn't see it when i came out the mall i seen my car window broken
Whoever did it, was looking for money they didn't care about anything else just money because i had a protable charger there that cost 350usd and my other phone they didn't take it they were just looking for the money
Good thing that i took my money with me so they didn't steal anything

But how did they know i had a big amount of cash with me?Omg this black lady  at the drive thrue she is so rude and told me not to go back there  wdh im a customerThis is definitely my favorite Chase branch! Valeria is the one who helped me; and I gotta say, her customer service is unmatched! Everyone at this branch is extremely helpful, and informative; but Valeria in particular is the one who keeps me coming back!Terrible customer service. I have an account with chase and they can’t even notarize a piece of paper…..Was told they weren't ""bonded"" to notarize my document. Went to Wells Fargo down the street and had no issues.Terrible customer service.

445,Chase Bank,"4335 Martin Luther King Blvd Ste B, Houston, TX 77204",Houston,"Chase closed Monday October 2nd and Tuesday October 3rd 2023 and will not answer phones! WHAT IS GOING ON WITH CHASE AND WHY ARE THEY HIDING FACTS ABOUT ALL CHASE BANKS BEING CLOSED!Bad, when my son passed. They tired to keep his money, an not let me have it. Even though my name was not on his account. Had to get  lawyer. I had death certificate, an was his mother. But lawyer got it for me. So I don't bank here but have to bring a friend he has an account here.I went thru the Drive Thru to buy a money order. Only to have my driver license and debit card handed to a stranger. For a bank to have an employee make that type of mistake is unacceptable. An apology means nothing when my personal information was handed to a stranger. I'm not worried about the debit card because we all know the banks covers unauthorized transactions. I received my debit and driver license back, however I will never again deal with them thru the drive thru. This upset me to the point the that I am looking to bank with other banks and shut this account down!Evelin L. Was very kind and helpful. Walked in and within in 2-3 minutes she was able to help me with my bank account information. If I had any questions, she’d answer them. She took her time with me, I didn’t feel rushed or anything at all. Thank you so much Evelin and Chase!Thank God I don't have a bank account with Chase because they're always always closed don't get a bank account with Chase cuz you'll never have access to your money only reason I go there is because I have to pay bills.I do not recommend scheduling a appointment with Julissa Perez , she’s not patient as well as rude & won’t help out much , won’t be coming to this place again especially when workers like her work there .Went in to change my beneficiary on my account and I was told it would be 2 weeks before I could talk to anyone.  I think I'll just change banks!Worst experience.... too long for appts(one week?!).. no walk-ins... long wait on phone...
Selecting another bank for sure...Friendly staff, always willing to help each as and every time I’ve been there.Disrespectful bank, I kindly reminded them to not forgot to lower there flag in respect to the Queen & they told me “were not in England”ATMs always broken or work extremely slow making you susceptible to getting robbed.EasyThey took good care of me, thank youIn this bank I have been discriminated against.

He was asking if my husband and I were Us Citizens and told us to go to o other branch where they speak Spanish. I told him my husband wanted to speak with a banker he said for what. I know Racism is not tolerated. We were very upset that’s not a way to treat people!! We are all equal. No matter people background!!Careful with any monetary transactions done at this location. Some robbers stalked me from this very bank, followed me TO MY WORKPLACE and broke into my car when I left. Because of the lack of a full-service drive thru, one HAS to walk into the building to withdraw their moneyThis place does not have Drive Through ATM.Horrible service. Went  there 7 times to open a new checking account and they always returned us back saying we’re missing something. We finally got everything we needed and made an appointment and they said we don’t have enough bankers to open your account. Not happy at all with this location and costumer service.

. I waited 15 mins still nothing. UnprofessionalWast of my time, Andrea Allison was inpatient, rude. She needs to work on her customer serviceBaucho Ton assisted me and my partner in opening a checking account...after 4 attempts and 3 different banks she made the process easier and even stayed after closing time just to make sure we were all good.I just was in the bank and I was standing in line and it was two ladies behind the desk. One was helping a customer and the other one was just on the computer. I noticed when I came up the lady who had a customer greeted me but the other lady who didn’t have a customer didn’t. I waited and still no greeting! Well when two other white people came in the line she then said how can I help you. It was a complete turn off. I got out of the line then came back and tried to ask who the manager was but she ran to the back. The other lady told me her name was Cammy. This is very unprofessional! I will be speaking someone above her to provide her with some coaching since she is the manager. So annoyed but I will make sure this complaint is heard.I was having trouble executing a business wire transfer online, so I went into the bank and got help from one of their bankers, Stephen Adrian. He was extremely helpful and knowledgeable, and fixed the issue immediately. Great service and I will definitely be returning to this location and asking for Stephen for any other banking issues.The most beautiful bank I've even been in.

Thank you 😊 …If you have a chase prepaid card from a plasma center your personal information will be sold to a scammer.. Beware friend you have been warnedThey always treat me and my daughter nice. But I see a lot of customer on the phone when the lady keep asking them What they need? I   Think that is so rude. Been on the phone when someone is talking to you.I am super impressed by Lily, who works in the lobby directing traffic in such expedient and professional manner.   When I walk in, I saw about 10 people in front of me and I thought to myself. what a bummer, it’s going to be a long wait.  But this young lady who works in the lobby apparently was very skilled at her job.  She directed customers to where they needed to go, including taking care of couple of issues herself in her cubicle.  So it was not long before we were seen.  I made sure I ask for her name before leaving the lobby area so I can leave a positive review about my experience at the bank.  I’ve been at various Chase bank before and this is the first time one of the staff really impressed me.  Thank you for doing a great job Lily!!!Went in to see if I could get their new red envelopes this for Chinese New Year (this was back in February 2022). Asked the counter clerk nicely, she reluctantly gave me 3 envelopes tied together with a rubber band. She had long hair, mainland Chinese accent, had her eyes rolled up half the time. I asked for some new notes, told me the government is not printing new notes this year and said 不信你可以去其他大通銀行詢問 Your job is to apologize politely for running out of new notes and NOTHING ELSE. I have never been treated with such disrespect at a bank before and challenged. I thought speaking mandarin would be an advantage but I realized the attitude change once they know you speak their language. Went to another Chase on Bellaire and Bissonnet near HEB, managed to get $500 in new notes big and small. Avoid this branch at all cost and don’t waste your time. (Also, I was given generously red envelopes in packs of 5s upon asking. With smiles on their faces too.)Super friendly stuff, especially Mr. Wu at the personal banking service. I didn't have an appointment but they still try to help me ASAP. I truly don't understand why people were giving 1-2 stars for their service. I had a very good experience.Absolutely terrible service. Extremely rude and don’t care about making appointments. Came in for the 4th time to open and account and they let a walk in come before me even after my appointment was made and told me I have to reschedule. Chase is the worse.All ATM on Bellaire blvd aren't working what is happening is impossible that are happening not sure but it is really badSorry this is long overdue. I wanna give a shoutout to Rainey. A couple of months ago, I went in there to open an account for my Mom. The others just told us to wait..15 min., then 30 minutes..blah blah (granted I didn't set appointment). Anyways.. Rainey approached us and just squeezed us into her busy schedule (she had a 10 a.m. appointment). Anyways.. she took care of us quick style. She was fast and showed signs of professionalism, as well as going above and beyond to take care of us. She deserves a raise!!! She is an example of who I would like to bank with.Lost my wallet. I have all ids except my debit card  because I lost my wallet. I open the account here.  Refuse to let me withdraw money. Because my original banker left to another branch, and tell me to go there.Thanks to Rachel and Dean for helping me open my accounts. They are so friendly and professional: answering my questions and following up. Great customer service!I came in for a CD but unfortunately, one of the male bankers here did a click to sign for me on that CD without letting me do the clicking or be in control of the mouse ):Love this branch, everybody so friendly , and very knowledgeable!!!!!!!!Low efficien. I waited here for almost 1 hour still I left no body came for help.Jonathan was such an amazing help!My First Experience in this Branch is impressive, The Counter Clerk was nice and Friendly. TODAY, the counter class are terrible, UNPATIENT, UNPROFESSION Al and terrible attitud. other bank. It' the worst bank experience. Customer review should be put in branch performance evaluation.

I suggest that you don’t come to this one in Chinatown if you want to do business. The service staff who open the account are very good, and the counter staff can’t be worse! I thought the cabinet lady was my boss! The attitude is arrogant and domineering! If it's just the counter staff, minus ten stars is too much10/29/22 around 9:50 Exchange 100 pcs of $1 on business line, only $88 when the next day counts, exchanged change in many different locations, the first occurrence of less money..

450,Chase Bank,"12802 Memorial Dr, Houston, TX 77024",Houston,"Sadly, I find the service at this branch to be pretty poor. As an example, I made an appointment a week in advance to see a private banker. I arrived 5 minutes before my appointment and also let a banker know I had arrived. I waited 35 minutes with no communication from anyone. Then I was told the bank was closed and I need to reschedule to another day. Time to find a new bank I guess. Pretty sad service :-(Awesome experience. Jess D. Wood best guy in this branch. Thank you so much Mr. Wood!Truly, these guys have reinvented my perception of banks.

451,Chase Bank,"712 Main St, Houston, TX 77002",Houston,"I opened a bank account with Chase back in the middle of June with a banker named Jonah. After everything was finalized. When I left I noticed I didn’t have my drivers license and bank card so I called the branch. Jonah proceeded to tell me I had forgotten them when in fact, he had them behind his keyboard and I just can’t reach across someones desk and grab them, had they been given back to me or put on the desk out in the open I wouldn’t have forgotten them. So he forgot to give them back to be and tried to blame me not accepting fault and apologizing. By the time I realized I didn’t have my drivers license and called it was close to closing time and I couldn’t have made it back with traffic. He said no problem I will put them in the safe and you can pick up at your convenience. Another inconvenience going back to the bank. A few days passed and I got busy with life and forgot to go and pick up my belongings. Then I was hospitalized a few days later for 8 weeks. Sent an email to Jonah with no reply. Fast forward. Yesterday, I emailed Jonah that I needed to pick up my things and explained what happened. Again no response to my email. So today I stopped by and he was with a client. A lady came to help me that was very friendly and she began looking for my drivers license and bank card. I didn’t get her name. A few moments pass and some passive aggressive man walks over who was not very friendly. He stated his name was Chris. He then tells me well you waited too long to pick up your things so they were shredded. Mind you had Jonah responded to my emails and calls I would have known this information and could have arranged for my mom or my husband to pick the items up for me. Then he stated that I understood that it would be shredded. I had no clue that was their procedure and for him to stand there any blatantly lie and put words in my mouth is ridiculous and he should be ashamed of himself; furthermore, I am now even more inconvenienced having to pay for another drivers license and waiting for it to come in the mail. Someone could have called to let me know beforehand that my items would be shredded. I said you have no business dealing with customers if you can’t own up to your mistakes and apologize, then turn and make everything the customer’s fault. Then he had the audacity to ask me for my ID when I asked to close my account. How comical because he said he was the one who personally shredded my items yet couldn’t give me an exact date. Thankfully I had my passport but I chose not to deal with him any further and will close my account once I speak with someone at corporate. I see why they have bad reviews. I asked the lady that was helping me for a number or email  to the branch manager or to corporate. Chris nonchalantly says just give her the business customer service number. I said isn’t that the same number on the back of my card? Why would she need to give that to me? I will never do business with chase again.Terrible experience, Bad customer service period!! Waited over 30 minutes and didn't even talk to a banker, No one greets you on the way in they don't have anyone there to help.. Stay away from this branch.I will never cash at Chase Bank they charge a 10$ fee to cash their own check if you don't have an account . That's robbery ! It's you own check why the fee .So I forgot my wallet at home and i needed to deposit money. They simply refused despite me showing them my ID on my phone as well as logging into my chase app. An inability to help a customer who just wanted to put money in the bank.I have banked with chase for over 10 years. I went to this branch to get a cashier’s check and then get a chase auto loan document notarized. No issues getting a cashier check. The banker who is the notary said he had a meeting coming in in 2-3 minutes that will last an hour and so he couldn’t notarize my document. The client wasn’t even there yet. Notarizing a document takes 60 seconds. Terrible customer service.This location closes it’s ATMs after hours in order to sell parking. While the selling parking is not an issue, it’s annoying that the ATMs are closed (building and drive through).Not sure it has an atmEMANUEL he is very helpful and patience associated with customers.My experience is easy and friendly.","Positives:

452,Chase Bank,"9709 Bellaire Blvd, Houston, TX 77036",Houston,"Andrea the assistant manager is friendly and nice. It was my first time in this location and i really liked how spacious and clean it was. the parking lot is super spacious too. i assumed it was a new one but apparently it's been here for 7 years!

i normally like the downtown one, just because it's spacious just like this one and you can actually breathe without feeling crammed. anyways im adding this one to my list!

pretty safe too i think, the security guard was doing his job instead of on their phones like some other branches.Bank entrance is in the back of the building. A bit different, But there’s a cute cop there watching. Bank is clean, but entrance has something in the way of going to tellers. Something nice here the tellers count the money, in front of you on the counting machine.The lobby can get pretty busy but the staff do a great job of making sure you’re taken care of. I have also walked in hoping to get papers notarized without an appointment and was in and out in less than 15 minutes. I’ve hit a bit of a snag with getting a Trust account opened, but I don’t think it was this branch’s fault.Be very careful when you have deposit in cash and you are on the drive thru.  One of the cashier likes to say you are short on money.  The same with the Chase from Westpark/Buffalo.I went in there to cash a check and then deposit it into my account. I specifically told the lady 3 times to do this so my money is available right away. She assured me she did and when I went to my car my money was not in my account and I had to wait 2 business days.

That being said, someone from the bank followed me to a taco truck and robbed me of my LV bag. So if yall want terrible service and to get robbed please go here!Mr. Scott is so helpful every time I stop by for any transaction needed.  Others are not too friendly or busy with others, but he has stepped up to help me out.  He also pays attention when it gets busy and steps in to help.Good customer service, usually two tellers on duty to help customers. Two ATMs inside in the lobby let's you do most basic functions. Parking is ample. Clean interior. Wait times are usually minimal.Fantastic customer service. Super positive interaction. MGMT at yale and 2nd branch take notes cause yall suck.Always greeted with a smile and BY NAME when I arrive in the drive thru! Talk about great customer service! I don’t even frequent this branch but Cecelia the drive thru teller always remembers me.Zero Stars - Highly recommend looking elsewhere for fiduciary services. Chase's main objective is to get your money and that's it. They will NOT hold their word on doing right by their clients. If you decide to do any business with a big bank, be sure to get ANYTHING spoken of in writing or they will take complete advantage of you. Senior and Executive management are pathetic at taking urgent matters. They don't care about you, all they care about is covering for their incompetent fiduciaries, so that they can steal your hard earned money. This bank has no integrity. ""Chase what matters""...elsewhere!I’ve never been to a Chase location that was so unwilling to help their clients. When I asked for explanations to understand better, they just state “that’s just the way it is.” Not willing to work with me on other solutions or ways to remedy the solution after waiting 30 minutes. Highly recommend going to a different branch if you need in person help.I love how even early in the morning the employees are so friendly and courteous. It’s a nice start to a hectic morning to see that kind of energy we all need. Thank you for having such a great team at this location.Customer service is terrible.  Going thru drive thru and only two cars in front of me, but took 30 minutes.  Another lady in next drive thru had been waiting even
longer.  Ridiculous!!!Expect to wait a minimum 20 minutes in the drive thru, even if you’re the only car. Rude, slow, they don’t care.SELL YOUR CHANGE TO CHASE!!! Put them in rolls cause they don’t count it. Got stiffed by the bank for $100 in quarters and they basically said too bad.They say the close at 6:00pm online but it looks like they leave earlier. Hours need to be adjusted.Banking with Chase over 20 years, never had issues. Friendly people that when I visit.Bad customer service. Only person with a good attitude was the security guard.I had a really good experience here today. Thank youThis is the worst run Chase Branch in town. Makes you want to leave the bank completely.","Positives:

454,Chase Bank,"600 McGowen St, Houston, TX 77006",Houston,"Private client. Stopped by for notary. Was greeted with poor customer service and told  to return in an hour. The representative acted like my request was a burden and not a perk of being a Chase Private Client. If you are a private client and looking for notary do not come to this location. Horrible customer  service with attitude.As a long-time customer, I was shocked by the lack of customer service I received during my recent visit. When I entered the bank, I was met with a long wait time and no acknowledgment from the staff. When I finally reached the teller, they seemed annoyed by my presence and were incredibly dismissive of my requests. I attempted to ask a question about my account, but the teller was unable to provide any helpful information and seemed irritated by my inquiries.

As someone who values good customer service, I was incredibly disappointed by my experience at Chase. It was clear that the staff members were more interested in rushing through their tasks than providing quality assistance to their customers. I left the bank feeling frustrated and disrespected.

In the future, I will be taking my business elsewhere. There are plenty of other banks that prioritize their customers and provide the high level of service that I expect. I hope that Chase Bank can take steps to improve their customer service and create a more positive experience for their clients.This has to be the worst Chase in Houston without doubt. And I’m counting the one where that lady got robbed and shot because at least SHE was able to get her money out. I’ve never seen a bank with CONSTANT machine issues. You need money? Expect it to take 4x as long as it would at literally any other branch. I avoid coming here like the plague. I’d rather deal with the traffic on Shepherd and go to the one on 19thSecond chase bank I set an appointment with to open a new account. Set the appointment two weeks out. I showed up on the day of the appointment and was told the lady that was going to set the account up Crystal was not there. Asked if anyone could help set up the account was told no. I was asked why nobody could of notified me of this and the teller just struggled me off like it was no big deal. I guess customers time doesn't mean anything to the people at this branch. They sure can send you an email reminder the day before you appointment, but cant let you know of a cancelation.SO TIRED OF ATM’s NOT WORKING!!!! ITS NOT JUST ONE BRANCH, ITS LITERALLY ALL OF THEM ALL THE TIME! DONE WITH CHASE MOVING ON TO CAP ONE!!! ✌🏻✌🏻✌🏻✌🏻 …Two drive-thru ATM lanes. Dispenses only $20s, only up to $800.Had a great experience opening up a joint account. Brian was super helpful and kind. He made us feel comfortable from the beginning. Thank you!Chase is my bank and they wanted to charge me $5 for a money order.  Right behind them is a Walmart with a Woodforest bank that charged me $2 for the same money order.  And I don't even have an account with them.

How embarrassing for Chase.

These comments are my opinions.  My opinions are based on my experiences.  Other people have different experiences and may have different opinions.Worst customer service eve, they promised to call you to schedule an appointment and that never happened, the whole experience is just badTried calling to make an appointment to open an account and no one answers. Walked in and manager says ""no one is available"" and they dont answer the phone ""because too busy.""  There were 6 employees I could see there all with no customers as I was only one there. Poor customer service in my opinion.Not sure why this branch exist. Horrible customer service not recommended at all. Don’t waste your time stopping by.The wors customer service.The manager Bryan is very nice and provide excellent service!Bad patronage in this location.The teller missed count 10k of my money.

I haven’t had a debit card for almost 2 years at chase but I still get deposits that go there from work. Therefore I’m always using this account & withdrawing money whether it’s through the drive thru banking or coming inside & they have never said I’m unable to withdraw anything “due to not having a debit card”… that’s why I’m at the bank & not the ATM tf.

456,Chase Bank,"4600 Hwy 6 N, Houston, TX 77084",Houston,"I have used this Chase location for YEARS, since at least the early 2000s.  I have done everything from drive-thru ATM to full retail services. (foreign currency purchases, account changes, etc.)

All though I have real complaints, my main point of contention with this location (in years past) has been there drive-thru speed.  I never use that service anymore because most of my transactions are fairly routine and I prefer to just get out and handle them inside.

Everyone has always been perfectly great and I have never had an issue with customer service here.Parking isn't ideal. Upon entering the bank, no one greets you or acknowledge you.  I completed a deposit slip at the counter and someone finally came to acknowledge me.  I get to the cashier counter. Saad asked how I can help you and I told him what i needed.  He took my documents and scanned them then immediately got on his phone.  After 2 minutes and me making noises to get his attention. He completed the transaction and slapped the slip on the counter and said here you go then walked away.  Didn't verify anything. Didnt ask any questions.  Didn't ask if I needed anything else.  Just walked away.  I found that unprofessional and rude!When did chase had such lower bars for employees? I was literally waiting in the front for almost 10 mins no one came to greeting or asking if there is anything I can help you? Plus they hire so many “advisors” more like I even don’t know how to describe them, I thought they were cleaning ladies at the beginning, super unprofessional super slow, late for my appointment for more than 10 mins while she had a cup of coffee in her hand, super chill? Excuse me! Talking is super slow, I feel super unsafe to put more money here anymore.Most of Chase banks leave courtesy behind. I was raised with a very nice Chase bank in Friendswood, so when my mother died I did all of her estate issues with Chase. Then I made a very big mistake --- I stayed as a customer. EVERYTHING is a huge drama there. The people I met with were so rude, absolutely no effort made towards civility and helpfulness. The last straw was using this location, located at SW Freeway and Buffalo Speedway. So very, very rude. I was shocked at the flippant and disrespectful behavior of the staff. I am sure they will be glad to hear I will NEVER darken their door again. But how can a bank with reviews like this one never see corporate oversize? Can it stand to be horrible, forever???Made an appointment here to open an account. When we showed up we were told the banker was wrapping up and would be with us shortly. He came out and told us he wouldn't have time for us because he was opening a business account (in other words he would rather get that business than tend to his appointments, I've worked in banking before I know how it goes). He was not even apologetic but he did offer to have someone else help us. He told us the banker would help us in 5 minutes. The second banker came out of his office, looked at us, didn't greet us and went into the break room. We waited another 5 minutes before deciding to leave. I've never been treated so poorly at a bank.You need to be very careful with the cash deposit you do on the drive-up banking.  This the second time the banker try to say I was short in cash.
Business deposit usually are bigger and I think is easier for them.  Very upset about it.Horribly understaffed. Waited for :20 min and then was told we couldn’t be serviced. Bank somewhere else.Actually lied to me about the status of my account and blamed another bank for their failure to transfer, went down the street to another bank who had no issue and confirmed that the staff at this branch lied and there was no issue. If I could give zero stars for customer service I would.Tried calling over three days to ask a question and no one has ever picked up the phone. Called Chase main office to complain.Worst chase branch I have been to. Very unhelpful staffThey are some big AHs if they don’t see you in a suit they won’t help you, their excuse you can do everything in the chase appWorst service of all. Dont go here. They will let you wait for nothing.Would give 0 stars if possibleSame as all^^^","Positives:

457,Chase Bank,"175 Yale St, Houston, TX 77007",Houston,"Worst branch of Chase...
Rude customer service is a waste of time.the most unbelievable experience with the manager!   she was a complete jerk, arrogant,  she holds zero consideration.  Down right horrible person!  Again this was the Branch Manager that I had this experience with..  I will be happy to elaborate if anyone wants details.Francisco slithers his way through not knowing anything by blaming all account issues on the customer. How about you learn something and not talk from your rear end?I wish they have zero start option.  They didnt want to cash one of there own checks.  Liz the cashier was rude. The account have the funds. I have the proper identification. They just didnt want to cash it.  They don't learn from Wells Fargo and there own experiences. Paying money for all the twisted activities the have done.Very poor customer service experience.

A couple of years ago I had a very bad experience with Francisco Villanueva. My mother, an 82-year-old, was receiving chemotherapy for stage 4 cancer and had to make a transaction, the two of us were inside the bank and she felt ill. She waited for me sitting in the lobby while I was making a transaction for her, but this man (Francisco) did not want to help me even though I explained that my mother was already inside the lobby a few steps away and she felt bad; he said she HAS to be in front of HIM despite being a few feet away and within eye distance. He didn't even make the slightest effort to help us or think of another option. This man needs empathy in situations like this when my elderly mother with cancer needed help.

Furthermore, yesterday (Feb 12) we just wanted to add my name to my daughters existing savings savings account. Lizbeth Flores attended us from the beginning very harshly without wanting to help; There are ways to explain to the client what is missing without being rude. She behaved so unprofessional that she even started to yell and argue with my husband inside the lobby, right in front of other customers and tellers. This is not the first bad experience I've had with this lady, she always attends with a very bad attitude. This was the final straw was when she started yelling at my husband in public. Very unprofessional and Chase should not employ someone that behaves this way under normal pressure.

Francisco and Lizbeth need to learn customer service from the Chase branch in Meyerland, a huge difference.Recent visit on 2-5-22 was a bad experience. If I had not found a personal banker to literally stand over and observe the teller run my transaction properly a second time, she would have gotten away with messing up people's transactions and feeding them a line of business jargon bs. Also observed them argue down a elderly lady as I was leaving. This is not a go to location if your looking for quality customer service.Best customer service! I love coming to my neighbor branch. The staff is so nice and professional they always go above and beyond to help you.Horrible customer service!! Branch manager Seema has suggested we had placed a torn overnight deposit bag inside and we lost 1770 dollars!!! DO NOT COME HERE unless you want to be accused when they’re missing your money and placing the blame on you!!! How disgusting

FILE A COMPLAINT IF YOU NEED TO!!IF I COULD GIVE 0 STARS I WOULD. WE HAVE LOST ALMOST 2 THOUSAND DOLLARS AT THIS BRANCH AND THEY WILL NOT EVEN HELP US FILE A CLAIM. WHICH WE CANT BECAUSE IT WAS AN OVERNIGHT DEPOSIT AND CUSTOMER SERVICE OVER THE PHONE SAYS THE CLAIM NEEDS TO BE INSIDE THE BRANCH AND THEY WONT DO THE CLAIM AT ALL! THEY KEEP POST PONING US AND TELLING US OTHER THINGS. SOMETHING SEEMS FISHY IN THIS BRANCH! DO NOT COME HERE!!!!Worst customer service they do stuff without advice you what are they gonna do .! Like stamp ur checks and not explain u why.!
Even later they run you out of the bank.’
Worst branch ever and Ilwe gad been customer of chase for more than 20 yearsAbsolutely the worst location you can go to. ATM's NEVER WORKHow can you NOT cash a check on your bank but tell me the funds are there for deposit only? What an inconvenience!Do not waste your time coming here! That’s all I’m going to say. Terrible customer serviceThe truth is very bad, when you call customer service to make an appointment they tell you that it is no longer necessary that in the past it was only due to the time of COVID-19 but when you go to the branch it turns out that the employees lack I respect that they are there, a fat woman who receives people tells you in a rude and offensive way saying sir, we are not going to attend to you here unless it is with an appointment, so if you do not have an appointment, we are not going to attend to you when in customer service by phone I They said it was no longer necessary to make an appointment.I have visited this bank several times, the treatment by Francisco Villanueva has really been excellent, it is for business accounts. All the staff are very friendly and speak Spanish. The only bad thing is that the place is very small. Before going you must make an appointment online on the Chase page and everything is faster.Excellent, excellent! I have been to many Chases but in this one from the custodian outside who greets you kindly, the people who receive you are always ready to help and with joy! I really congratulate you! It's nice to go to this Chase Bank! Thank youThey don't want to work, they were sitting around doing nothing and they don't serve peopleHello, good afternoon. Ashley, the cashier, feels bad as if I were stealing something, she looks at me in a strange way, very, very bad service. That's no way to treat people.The truth is, I work and it's hard for me to wait until 9:00 a.m. for them to open, oh, come in the afternoons because they close very early, so that doesn't help me at allI wanted to open an account and they asked me for a lot of requirements. I went to another of the same banks and they took good care of me, but this bank was the worst.Terrible customer service, the Spanish-speaking girl is rude and arrogant, I would never return therevery beautifulFor me he is the best of all!!","Positives:

You can’t call a real person, you HAVE to make an appointment to see anyone, they won’t notarize anything anymore and the people who sit behind the desks are not consistently there day to day. They must rotate banks or something. They always have people running around with their little iPads looking like their busy, but what are they doing? My reason for joining Chase was they are obviously nationwide. But what does that get me? I’m changing to a more local bank. Chase no longer has the words “customer service” in their training manuals anymore.The WORST experience I’ve ever had at a chase. Nina Seummalavanh is such a rude, arrogant individual. She made a mistake on her part, yet refused to hold herself accountable. Instead belittled and blamed me.I went in to set up an business account Geraldine was amazing i was very pleased with her service. Great Job !Horrible customer services
Branch manager changes every other day.
Not stable at all for customer services. Run from this location.Walked in around 2:40. We were approached by a woman. She was nice but she said she couldn’t help us because our transaction would take about 25 minutes and they were closing. I have never been somewhere we I show up BEFORE they are closed and I am turned away. Just because she wants to get off of work and enjoy her Saturday and can’t help someone for 5-10 extra minutes after her shift. I won’t be coming back to this chase. Most of the reviews validated that this is a terrible branch. I used to have an account & my husband has one now. We willl be leaving chase!I am very satisfied with the service I received today at this branch. The banker that helped me was Nelofar Farzam she was very polite and knowledgeable. I had been to 2 other branches that could not update my account information after sitting for hours. Nelo updated it and fixed my problem in about 10 minutes. I live 30 minutes away but I’ll drive back to this branch if I need any other assistance with my account. Thank you Nelo 🤍There is no one to greet you when you walk in.

I said my name and he didn't even ask me twice just once. I really appreciate that. It is really rude to ask someone's name twice like there is something wrong with it.So this band decided to quickly lock my card at the ATM, for no reason.  Literally put my card in and loading for more than 20 minutes. After-hours so no help.  One of the many reasons why I'm considering switching banksWaited almost an hour till 4:45pm when I was acknowledged to get my papers notarized. Took them 1 minute to dismiss me to say they can't notarized it because my signature was already signed, but not in front of them. I had an hour to sign that paper while waiting for someone to assist me at my seat. Lady then had the audacity to tell me to go back home and get another print and come back with only 13 minutes till closing time for them. Chase customer service has gone downhill.None of the ATMS are working … and usually only one works. Chase has been doing bad .App not working and customers cannot even go inside the bank to do transactions!ATM machines are garbage.. always down .. I don’t know what’s going on with chase .. it’s the same problem all over town mostly of then are out of service .. one day works good the following day something is wrong .. hopping they do something anout this problem that keeps happening again and againLong lines all time just one window person..The teller was great but when trying to speak with a banker and patiently waiting for the one banker who was visibly busy, another person was let in to see them before me.

They go from bad to worse. ATMs never work, right now not a single one works. And it smells musty until it can be harmful to our health to be there. Since they have a Hispanic general manager, everything has been damaged. I'm moving to Wellsfargo this week. It's much better. My husband has an account there and I like the way they treat them. And the ATMs are always workingThe ATMs are almost always bankrupt and to go to the inside ATM it turns out that you can't either, it's lacquered, it's ridiculous that we are in line with 8 cars waiting for a single ATM. 😡Bad attention","Positives:

I was talking to same people it took them months put my money back but following day they took it back. Statements don't match and they won't hhelp,"me. Terrible customer service. Stay away.
        The staff at this branch were very helpful in assisting me with setting up my new business account. They took the time to explain the different account options and helped me choose the best one for my needs. Great customer service.
        I had a negative experience at this branch when I needed to dispute a fraudulent charge on my account. The staff were dismissive and unhelpful, and it took a long time to get the issue resolved. Room for improvement in handling fraud claims.
        This branch has convenient hours and a fast and efficient teller line. I appreciate that I can quickly deposit or withdraw money without a long wait.
        I had difficulty accessing my online banking account and went into this branch for assistance. The staff were patient and knowledgeable, and they were able to resolve the issue quickly. Good customer support.
        Overall, the staff at this branch were friendly and attentive. They made me feel valued as a customer and provided excellent customer service. 
        The waiting area in this branch is very cramped and uncomfortable. There are not enough seats for all the customers, and it can get quite crowded during peak times. Improvement needed in seating arrangements.
        I had a positive experience with the loan department at this branch. The staff were thorough in explaining the loan terms and answering all my questions. They made the application process smooth and easy. Satisfied with their service.
        The ATM machines at this branch are frequently out of service or malfunctioning. It's frustrating to come to the bank and not be able to access cash or make deposits. Maintenance of ATMs needs improvement.
        The tellers at this branch are always friendly and efficient. They greet customers with a smile and handle transactions quickly. A positive banking experience.
        Miscellaneous:
        - The branch is conveniently located with ample parking available.
        - The branch could benefit from better signage to help customers navigate the different sections.
        - The branch has a clean and organized appearance.
        - The branch should consider offering more educational workshops or resources for customers to improve financial literacy."

Much better than the last time we were thereHello Ms. Keller,

My name is Prince Riley a customer at chase. I entered your location 10-27-22 around 230pm to make a cash deposit. Upon my completion of my transaction. I exited the branch leaving my debt card.

Upon my realization of me leaving the branch I noticed I did not have my debt card with me. I then contacted employees at this location regarding this issue.

Before even notifying as a valued chase customer with my First middle last name stated on the card. My debt card was destroyed without no notification from your employees. Which I believe isn’t proper communication with me because I am a chase customer.

When asked why I was not contacted regarding the issue.
Tra’Vion Morris
ID E730770

Stated she did not know I was not contacted. Which makes no sense to me. As well as
Christina Flores
F73341

She received the card from another customer and destroyed It without proper notification. The card was not even at the location for no more than 30 mins.

This is unacceptable that a staff operates in this manner. I understand the card can be replaced that is not the issue proper communication and courtesy was not taken at all. Highly unacceptableTerrible branch. I saw BERNICE CASTANEDA about refunding a couple fees I had on my account totaling $15.00 and she said the ""system"" would not allow her to process the refund. I asked her to have her manager override it so she goes over to her manager and comes back saying it wouldn't let her process either. Manager didn't even come back with her to provide an explanation. Needless to say, I''ll be looking into closing my account and credit cards and moving my money elsewhere. I've been with Chase since 2006 and the customer service I rec'd today was awful. I wouldn't recommend anyone putting their money here or any other services for that matter. Rude employees that act like they're doing you a favor but actually do nothing for you.If you do not have an account officer, I suggest contacting Sara Estrada. She moves from another branch, and I follow her. I feel like a VIP client when working with her. Everyone else I had an interaction on this location was very cordial. Thanks.Sara and Humaira were very helpful to open my business account.Great service. Thank you","Positives:

462,Chase Bank,"6701 S Texas 6, Houston, TX 77083",Houston,"This bank needs to move, only has 1 atm at the moment and 1 walk up, traffic happens immediately on busy hours due to one atm, and the parking is horribleThey are quick, friendly and have notary! I spoke to the Bank Manager and he stated he has 4 notaries in total and tries to have a notary working during branch hours! Thisnis def a plus for me!

I know of 4 chase Banks that don't have any.Had money being deposited direct to my chase  account through the 2021 year for covid relief and irs upwards of 10-12k+ throughout the year. Deposited in large amounts from 5k to 8.4k im not so tech savy so  i would go and ask for the balance in person every 3 weeks or so and check to see if the money had been deposited and they would always tell me no that there was no money deposited.  It wasnt till I did my income tax at the end of the year that i realized there is a questionable 10k-12k that i have questioned who took it out and they say i went there and took it out in person i ask for video proof but since its been well over 6 months a they  dont keep records that old. i could never get any help from the workers there. this isnt the first time i had an issue with money with chase about 4 or 5 years ago i had realized someone took out  around 500 dollars and i did get that back after i caught it, the bank didnt. for these reasons im going to another bank might.If you’re looking for a Chase with a drive thru, don’t come here. They stopped doing drive thru service.Nice Bank friendly peopleBadThanks VanessaWell, I had an appointment and the agent who would attend me got sick, and they didn't notify me, I lost almost half a day of work for nothing, and they didn't receive me, and they wanted to give me another appointment on another date, I would have to miss another day of work. .
I'm sorry he got sick, but the bank should have put someone in his place to keep the appointments that are already scheduled.","Positives:

She led me to Jacqueline who also did a great job helping me open my very first direct deposit bank account !!!!!! Great job ladies!!!!I visit this bank almost everyday and the teller Erick has a horrible and nasty attitude, very unprofessional and should not be working in customer service. MANAGER please have a talk with your employee.They are so unprofessional and lazy. I wish I would’ve read the reviews before I went there. The banker Jacqueline Miron and her manager are absolutely no help at all.The overnight deposit drop box has not been accessible in weeks.  It seems chase does not care about the customers at that location.  When will it be  fixed?Please don’t go here they have the worst customer service you get more help at other locations than this dumpThis has to be the absolute WORSE Chase bank in Houston. The customer service is so unprofessional, the ATM's are ALWAYS broken, either it is broke  or it won't accept deposits. This goes on for days, this is a very large area and this community deserves better.This particular branch/location is always short handed (long lines) and the atm’s never work properly.ATMs seem to never work and service could be, betterWorst location ever.

464,Chase Bank,"1405 S Voss Rd, Houston, TX 77057",Houston,"Went to this branch to open an account without appointment. The lady at the  entrance checked my wife's social security, checked what all documents we brought with us etc. at the entrance itself. They did not even have the courtesy to offer a seat to sit. We only got an appointment 4 days later to our liking.

We went to San Felipe branch next. Completely different experience. Walk-in without appointment. This branch was very nice. The staff here showed lot of respect and walked us through the entire process very nicely.I went in to try to make a deposit and I was greeted by the manager I believe her name was Laycil. She asked if she could help me and I said like every time I am wanting to make a deposit so I went over to the deposit slip counter and she said you don’t have to do that so I looked over at all the teller booths and there was nobody there and I’m like we’re all the tellers and she rudely said we don’t call them tellers anymore. And I’m like oh some people do and she said well I don’t And she also said she was the manager but she continued to argue and just didn’t really treat me very nicely. Anyway, I see that this particular location has a very low score as a matter of fact on reviews a one out of five the number one bar is completely full It’s a shame because Aurora at the 19th St. location in Houston is the best manager/representative you could ever ask forI went into the bank and used the automatic teller for a withdrawal of $500 in one hundred dollar bills.  I wanted brand new or crisp $100 bills for a Super Bowl squares pool.  After I withdrew the money and before I could even ask, one of the bank employees roaming the floor asked if I needed any help.  I explained my situation and she directed me to a teller.  I now have my crisp $100 bills.  I've been to this branch many times before and every interaction with the employees has been nothing but exceptional.  They're truly nice people just simply wanting to help.  I'm surprised the Google rating for this branch is so low; they have excellent customer service.Worst banking experience ever.  Opened an business account and deposited a significant amount (for a small business) to the account.  All the checks cleared and the funds were shown as available on the account within 4 business days.  After the funds were shown to be available, a wire transfer was initiated only to be rejected.  Had to call to find out that Chase had frozen the account because the checks deposited didn't match the business name.  If that were the case, why were the checks accepted in the first place??  A day later Chase decided to close the account and refused to release the funds back to the business.  At the time the account was opened, it was clearly explained that the business has several DBA's and the documentations were provided.  The banker failed to submit all the documents that were provided which caused a nightmare for the business.  Chase held on to the money that didn't belong to them for almost 2 months causing a nightmare for the business with rent payment and payroll due among other bills.  The amount deposited was very significant for a small business.  It took many many hours and days on the phone with Chase to finally have them release the funds that didn't belong to them.  It took having to resubmit the same documents that were provided at the time the account was opened to be reviewed by a different department to prove ownership and that the DBA's were tied to the business in order to get the money back.  So many wasted hours on the phone and stress from a mistake trying to open an account with Chase.   Consumers beware!  Go with another bank!They discriminate against non-us citizens and talks in condescending tone. Very rude.ATM machine do not work 24/7 at back. Please dont risk your life to something that do not work. Not safe as all. No warnings.This location's drive through is absolutely terrible!
They are always making mistakes on withdrawals and deposits. Would not recommend!The worst bank ever no body to recommend to go there.I came yesterday they say u have to appointment ok I did it .and come in morning but the person says u have to be citizens passport unless u can to open account in chase Am surprise I west my time two days !!!!!..What is your swift code?Ms. Lacey was awesome and so was the Thanks giving feastLiterally stood in the lobby 5 minutes and every one turned into Ray Charles.I've been a customer for less than 4 hours and I am already hugely disappointed with their terrible customer service.🙂🙂🙂 …","Positives:

465,Chase Bank,"929 E Little York Rd, Houston, TX 77076",Houston,"Couldn't help me and couldn't tell me why.  The info from their customer service number was always the opposite of what they told me in the bank.  I've never been given the runaround as much as I was here.Everybody hiding and eating. 327 p.m. next appointment is at 4:00 p.m. I've been in there for 30 minutes no one had walked in other than to go to the counter
All the bankers were supposedly. Went to a different branch today on
I walked in I was greeted with the hello what can I do to help you
Within 7 minutes I left out the door
With my bank account activated . They  need new  some Management

.

Update fromQuince was extremely rude to me and none of the clerks were friendly it was dead. And everyone was acting like it was an inconvenience for us to be there. I was made to go to the back of the line when he helped another customer in the same spot. I don’t appreciate being treated unfairly I was extremely polite and that still couldn’t get me good customer service. He was so rude to me and treated me unfairly. I’ve been a long time customer and will continue to come here and do not want these kind of negative interactions. Please have a conversation with this locations team about customer service. I’m going to start leaving bad reviews for every bad experience I have here  so fix this. Not acceptable.These employees are more frustrating then the 6th graders I teach. I rarely get a completed assignment without literally begging, pleading and repeatedly asking for the same thing.  If I ask for something very specific it's met with blank stares. They make promises to pass on the information to a manager because they're the only ones who can help but I have yet to receive a phone call and it's been 3 weeks now.I normally don't leave reviews but this location has been absolutely awful. They have given me false information on two separate occasions which was refuted by other branches and Chase upper management. Can’t emphasize enough the headaches this branch has caused.The lobby card machine to let you in to use the atm has been broken for like a year now I called the customer service they said it should be available 24/7 4 people have tried to use it now as I sit behind 8cars wating to use their ONE drive thru atmThis place sucks. Walked in for help. No one was there. Walked to one of the windows and the guy was like I can't help you. I asked well do u know where they can help Me. Another bank location at least and he responded. Can't help you. Don't know there schedules. 😕 he didn't brother to ask someone else if they knew or if the people in the offices are free to help meI normally don't leave reviews.  But this location really needs to be staffed properly.  Only 3 bank tellers and when i asked to speak to a bank rep on the floor about a sensitive matter, I couldn't get help.  They acted like they didnt really want to help.  and said there was no one on the floor.  Train your people with better customer service and staff it right!  i only work in this area so i guess i have to go elsewhere to get proper assistance.This Staff is amazing Laura or Lauren and the other tellers on hand were awesome and tremendously helpful. I had a cashiers check that took a while to get approved. But, they were very professional and swift to call customer service and have this issue resolved. I recommend this branch to any and everyone, Excellent customer service. Adam D.How are they changing to cash check that belongs to them, that's ridiculous. That's way I don't want to do any business with.I would give them 0 stars but I was not allowed. Bad customer they bad attitude. I don't why a keep trying with chase one of the biggest bank but no improvements.Was in line outside for over 20 minutes and not one single car moved. I had to reverse go inside and wait another 25 minutes when I only had 1 person in front of me in line. 1 lady was working the counter while the other 1 was just typing on the computer ignoring every single person inside. Worst bank worst service.The worse branch ever!!!! Some of the nastiest attitudes I have ever witness!!! The tellers act like frighten mice and the people that work the lobby have a DEPLORABLE  demeanor. They need to be fired! Go to the branch on 43rd and Ella they know what customer service is and are super helpful!Came on Saturday. Guard refused to open even after 10 am. it's opening hour and a line already. Says they're still not ready. Got an incompetent newbie Oriental man. It took forever for him to close my account. A line formed. And he didn't even close my debit card.Only one ATM and its broken most the time. Drove to another branch, same thing.  ( For night Deposits ) They obviously don't want your deposit. Closing all the accounts and transferring to a bank that cares about their customers.Lazy.  No customer service.
Worst branch everThis branch is the WORST! They are not interested in helping you at all. No one available to help. Won’t even make eye contact. They just sit at the computer typing ignoring everyone.the manager should be fired.Do not use the drive up ATM here. Went to deposit cash and the machine glitched and took $300+ from us without it depositing into our account. Now we have to call customer service to hopefully get it sorted out.This branch is the WORST! They are not interested in helping you at all. No line. No one available to help. Won’t even make eye contact.Trouble makers. Making the life harder, any process longerVery bad service. There is only one cashier on duty and she talks a lot with customers no matter what people are waiting for. And the other cashiers are just doing nothing.

469,Chase Bank,"5020 San Felipe St, Houston, TX 77056",Houston,"I had a wonderful experience with everyone in this place. Everyone was so welcoming which contributed to my pleasant experience.  I had scheduled an  appointment with Alyssa and she was so helpful with all my questions and swiftly handled my account. In addition, she even gave me a free pen at the end and wished me luck on my upcoming travels. I recommend her for any appointments.This bank location racial profiles.

Bank manager provides one of the worst customer services, I’ve experienced.Five star service. Mrs Phillips and Mrs Dawkins  go  above and beyond for their  customers. My elderly grandmother at97 was hacked. They went above and beyond to make switching accounts a smooth transition getting all bill payments moved . Mrs Phillips even came out to the car for some last minute
paperwork that needed to be signed when my grandmother was sick. Absolutely five star customer service from this branch.

You are not just a number to the staff here you are treated as  family.The only thing about Chase that I don't like is that the ATMs are sometimes always out of service.Absolutely terrible. Commercial and standard clients beware. This bank never has change, and when it does we are prompted to call in our change order for speedy service. However once we arrive we are either told they don’t have the previously arranged change order or we are forced to wait for 30 minutes. This place lacks in training and customer service. Though this establishment is located in a less wealthy community does not mean we deserve less than others. It is such a hassle to drive elsewhere, our neighborhood bank needs to step up. We demand answers and results chase bank.Another happy customer. I went in for some statement print outs and was taken care of within 15 min. Very satisfied!

She was very informative and honest about the services and credit cards that I was interested in. She took the time to answer all of my questions and made sure that I understood everything before I left. I would definitely recommend her to anyone looking for a banker.”The wait is excruciating. Tellers aren’t trained or given authority so you wait some more for supervisors. Then they spend more time explaining why it’s your fault you have to wait! Avoid like the plague!
DO NOT believe they have a drive through as info is unreliable.The customer service at 2435 Kirby is excellent! Tanner was very helpful even though Chase could not solve my problem of retrieving my old 2004 bank statements.Never really a racist experience until today and I’m 37 ,you’d think out all places to be racially profiled it wouldn’t be at a bank.

473,Chase Bank,"12214 Jones Rd, Houston, TX 77070",Houston,"The bank was updated. Private client services and all staff were excellent.  No line.  Large parking lot.  I drive a little longer but this branch takes less time, better customer services, and saferMy cousin had his account robbed at this bank before his account was even set up, they let the robber present a fake ID, and the security didn’t catch it. The purp withdrew thousands of dollars before my cousin even got his debit card. He had to find out from a third party credit monitoring app, and chase did NOTHING. They denied his claim and now he has to file a police report. The OCC WILL be hearing about this! PLEASE DONT BANK HERE, YOUR MONEY IS NOT SAFE AND THEY WILL LAUGH AS YOU GET SWINDLED OUT OF YOUR LIFE SAVINGS!DO NOT BANK WITH CHASE THEY WILL CLOSE YOUR ACCOUNT, with no given reasoning! They don’t care if u got bills to pay, or the reasoning why they closed your account!The teller with the braids is extremely rude! He gave me information incorrectly twice and was trying to charge me for something I know for a fact its free with the type of account I have. I was asking general questions about getting my money back from the credit card as I got a refund of over 4 thousand dollars and my credit card was already paid and refuse to help. I don't understand why he had such a bad attitude to the point that i had to tell him to deescalate the situation and was not friendly until the manager which end up agreeing with me started to help me yesterday February 11 2023. Its a shame because I live so close to this location but this individual has been rude to me several times now! I will refuse to be serviced by him from now on and will ask for someone else every single time until he learns how to approach customers. Helping us shouldnt have to be hostile specially when the customer is being understandable. Wanted me to recite my bank account like people know every number and legit made me log into the app when I had inserted my debit card and had put my pin. Extremely rude!! Also why are the ""good comments"" the same several times??? Very suspiciousI tried to get a document notarized. A banker greeted me and prompted to help me. But he found out they only had one notary and who was fully booked. A bank is of no use if they can’t help with the business.Ashley Hernandez is a wonderful bank manager. She is attentive, and follows through with what she says she will do.  I think that Ms. Hernandez and  the employees that I have met at this location are excellent.Always prompt, never had an issueTerrible customer service and terrible bank policies they won't honor their own checks if you don't have an account after 2 times and they charge a fee to cash their own checks Chase bank is the worstAlways a great experience.","Positives:

477,Chase Bank,"14400 Memorial Dr, Houston, TX 77079",Houston,"The one certified bank manager on duty left for lunch today leaving two business customers in the lobby.  We were told to have a seat and someone would help us but no one else was in the bank qualified to work with accounts.  Mr. Milton Velez was more interested in lunch than helping bank customers.   Eleven years with Chase and this is the service available at this branch.They didn’t want to reverse two service fee charges of $12 watch because I need $1,500 in my account to avoid the service fee, my other bank does not do service fee charges at all and to me that is stealing money from people. I do not recommend this bank to anyone. They would not let me close my account until I paid the fee.I had an appointment with MILTON VELEZ at 12:00 pm. Due to traffic i reached there at 12:09 pm. He did not give me the 10 minute mark and lied that he called me but he did not. He asked me to wait until 12:30. At 12:30 he came again to come back at 1:30 pm. He lied to me again and again. Such unprofessional behaviour.Horrible experience every time. Incredibly lazy staff that makes every excuse possible not to help. Supposedly they only notarize on certain days at certain times but can’t tell me those dates and times. Highly recommend taking your business and money elsewhere. 0/5 customer serviceShannon, the VP at this location, is great!  She made it easy to resolve my issue and I was out of her office in about 5 minutes.  It's so wonderful that she is so knowledgeable and respectful of other people's time.  As I was waiting for my appintment, I noticed she spoke to almost every customer that came in the front door to make sure they got help as efficiently as possible.My experience in this branch was not good . The accountant Milton Velez wasn't supportive and understandable. Due to his negligence, I have to wait 2 hours.I had a great experience with Rosa Pecina. I came in to get a document notarized and she was very professional, personable, and was a great help. Thank you, Rosa!Manager don’t know how to talk to customers. She treats everyone what ever she think. And doesn’t listen what customer is saying .Anna was very rude! I asked her if she can look up my acct to check on a deposit. She asked for my ID in my card and she said she couldn’t find a deposit for the 274 that I asked her to check! So she rudely pushed my ID and card under the window and told me to call the 800 number because they can see other things that they can see in the bank as far as transactions! Which I know it’s untrue because I work for another bank and they can view transactions as well as calling over the phone! She was to busy to get back to her phone. Which she was on the phone while at the teller window! I will close my account at Chase and I will not ever continue to do business with Chase Bank!Went to chase to try to open a joint account. The teller and supervisor were very unhelpful. Directed me to the website since it was a hour before they closed. I decided I’m Not opening a account with unprofessional people who don’t know how to treat their customers.Clearly there are a lot of employees just sitting down not doing nothing yup I passed thru the front and saw a lot of cackling I’m calling the phone and no one is answering, with a long line outside with only one drive up open makes no senseHorrible customer services. I waited an hour for them to tell me that the banker is booked all week and I needed to come back the following week. Huge waste of time.Good bankTypical Chase Bank

Good thing the one inside is inaccessible since the card reader for the door doesn't work for digital wallet or actual card.This Branch is careless, very rude customer service. Tanya Thanh Do applied my credit card payment to the wrong one without verify the information and she claimed is my fault
Her manager, Violet gave me the 800 to call and that department stated is the branch’s fault they have to look for the money and correct it but they don’t care
They should be no star not even one
Chase should hire the better employeesDo not come to this location ATM always broken! This atm must have some kind of a  illness it’s always broken at least once a month.Rather than the other Chase branches, this specific branch is a complete mass. I never saw that they solve a problem quickly. It seems they also have lack of knowledge even for simple banking transactions. When I ask for something that was done with other Chase branches in the past, they say that the system does not allow them to do.

So, same bank, same brand but a terrible branch. I would prefer to go 30 miles back to do banking with another Chase branch.Usually pretty quick service if you need to go inside. Sometimes busy.I typically prefer coming to this branch because the people there are really kind and helpful. Today was an important visit for me. Ngoc greeted us at the door and took care of it for us right away. They went above and beyond for us. We are really grateful, Thank You Ngoc!Big banks and big pharmas are falling apart in front of our eyes.

479,Chase Bank,"8140 W Sam Houston Pkwy S, Houston, TX 77072",Houston,"I had an unfortunate situation happen which required me to go into a branch to resolve the issue. I initially went to the location at 3203 Southwest Fwy. I was there for maybe a total of 10 minutes just for them to tell me there was nothing they can do for me. I felt defeated as I had been trying to resolve the issue by phone for a few days and now a banker is telling me “there’s nothing we can do”. The following day I decided to get a second opinion so I came to this location. Sharon is a rockstar. She helped me resolve the issue, stayed in contact with me every day until it was settled. I am forever grateful for her help. I would recommend her for any of your banking needs!Horrible customer service!  After following my accountant's  advice, we first went in to open a new business account, and we're told that we couldn't because they closed in 30 minutes. Giving them the benefit of the doubt, we went ahead and scheduled an appointment for the following day at 4:00 pm. We arrived the following day at 4:07, when we walked in Liz Diago, who was supposed to be assisting us, was in her office doing notaries, so we waited for 10 minutes for her to finish. Liz then came out and said that she couldn't help us because she got off at 5:00! Even if THEY PAID ME, I would not open anything with these peole! So, instead, my FCU will get my multi-million dollar account. I actually kinda feel bad for Lizo. She just let $10,000,000 walk out the door.They don't have bankers here.  An ATM would help more than anyone in this bank.Worse customer service EVER at 5505 Kirby! Prime example of people not wanting to do what they are paid to do.Fast and friendly!

I had called another location, and they seemed to be a bit careless about the entire situation. I called this location and they immediately began offering superior customer service.

This place is great the environment is very helpful.I want to give some positive praises to a young lady by the name of Lily who works at the front lobby.  Upon entering the bank, I was kind of annoyed by the number of customers in front of me and how long I anticipate I will have to wait before being seen.

However, I was quite surprised and impressed by how quickly I was actually seen because of the way Ms. Lily carried out here job.   She was super efficient in directing customers in front of me to the appropriate stations and people as well as taking care of a couple tasks herself while answering questions people in line had.  She was also highly cognizant of which customers came in first and took care of people in the order they came in despite some were in line and some were sitting.

She did all of this with not only professionalism but with a pleasant courteous demeanor.  Honestly, I was very impressed and felt the need to leave a positive review in hopes the branch manager will reward and encourage such behavior.  I left feeling good about my banking experience because of Lily.  Well done Lily👍All ATM on Bellaire blvd aren't working what is happening is impossible that are happening not sure but it is really badThis bank is useless. i wish my job was so easy. manager drives a red tesla so he probably gets paid very well but if you ask him for help to apply for a new credit card or debit card all he tells you is "" use the mobile app "". like dude i came to the bank physically to get help in person not to be told to use the mobile app. I'm disappointed, will be transferring my money to another bank and closing all my chase accounts.Bank had 1 banker who was not present when I went on a Thursday, and was apparently fully booked for the next week. How you gonna have a bank with no banker lol what. Tellers were very kind though.Not good customer service. She deny to make print of one paper.

482,Chase Bank,"5505 Kirby Dr, Houston, TX 77005",Houston,"Went to chase during my lunch break to speak to a Chase associate that could help me set up the Chase phone app since it didn’t recognize non of my credentials when I was trying to do it myself. The lady there told me that I needed to set up an appointment and I thought that was kinda weird since I was the only one there yet no one could help me. So I left and been calling for 3 days and no one ever picked up the phone. I then started reading the reviews and that’s all it took for me to call another location which was the total opposite of this branch. This branch needs better management is all I’m going to say because it always starts from the Top down.This Chase Bank is Horrible!!! To start my clerk had the situation handled and was communicating well. All of a sudden some gloomy looking women jumps in the conversation and is immediately speaking with an attitude while I’m just trying to get clarification on the situation. She needs a nap or something cause she looked wore out and the attitude and energy was so nasty. Eww, chase bank do better because her energy transferred over to the clerk who was helping me in a matter of seconds. So Glad I don’t bank with them but if you do , avoid this location at all costs . They might as well close this location solely based on the womens demeanor. Get her out of customer service asap and behind a computer with no interactions with people because she seriously lacks social and communication skills and I’m sure many other skills as well just based on her dirty sulky attitude. Clean it upI honestly don’t understand how this place don’t got a drive thru atm and the front door doesn’t work so you can’t even access the indoor atmCalled multiple times during work hours. No one answers no matter which option you select. I called 8 times back to back one day and nothing...I figured I could annoy someone into answering but their willpower is stronger than mine.Maybe I just don't feel comfortable trying to read how to use the magnetic bank card locked door feature, but its not easy to operate if I have to read the 5 steps with the images on the side.  Either have the doors work or just turn your light off and close them with metal gates.This location is horrible!! The ATM stops working on a weekly basis. You can wreck your car in parking lot because entrance is so small. I couldn't use the drive thru ATM so I tried to go inside the bank. Well, No can't do that either because the card reader won't let me in the door to get to inside ATM. Ridiculous Chase Bank!! I am finding another bank to go to!!!It was a great experience, the staff guided me through and help me, it was the first time I made a deposit, and they were nice.PATRICIA VAZQUEZ was extremely helpful with my issue of the ATM swallowing my money. She is an asset to the organization.Ingrid was very nice and professional, helpful, patient. Very welcoming!Service is horrible!!

There was no problem until they counted my packaged coins, they returned more than $50 dollars because supposedly the banker Osiel, some packages had more and another less.

484,Chase Bank,"13070 Bellaire Blvd, Houston, TX 77072",Houston,"Today was a great morning in Houston, fresh and warm, right up to the moment when I met a certain Jose Robledo on my way. I was heading to one of the Chase Bank branches, this man rudely stopped me and said we are still closed, sit in your car!
Hey man, I didn't come to visit you at home, I came to my favorite bank, be kind enough to speak politely if you work there, who are you to tell me what to do?
The impression of the service in the bank is created by its employees who love their work, but apparently he does not like this job, I advise the bank's management to think about whether such an employee is needed.This is a wonderful branch that clearly cares about their customers and knows how to help them! I went into this bank this morning because of a document discrepancy issue (not their fault) that resulted in my business account being restricted. The bank manager clearly understood how critical it was to get this fixed. She got me in with one of the bankers immediately and then she actually personally took over helping me when he had to work with another customer. It took a couple hours, but they were great and so helpful! The issue was resolved before I left!I’ve had multiple items notarized without appointments here four times. Everyone I spoke with or had interacted with were nice and helpful. My only complaint is there should more ATMs available for drive thru or drive up.Came in for something simple but Ms Quynh took care of that and gave me other chase offers that I will need in the future. Definitely will come back later on. 10/10 recommend Quynh!Was informed to come back couple of times to open a bank account and to get documents notarized. Finally had setup an appointment and went there. The teller was looking exactly for driving license as an ID which I didn’t have yet. Then he informed that he will not accept the passport and US visa as a “valid ID”. Was flabbergasted to hear that he will not accept the valid US visa as a valid document for verification.David Barnswell - The manager is awesome. He went above and beyond to help us out during the Friday rush. Really appreciate all his help. Sincerely.I didn’t dress up when I was arriving the bank. Was that the reason  Diego. V was treating me not very well ;)Horrible they won't cash a check because the system tells them not to::These branch decide instead you, to whom you want to speak. They send to check with a teller to avoid having you seat down with bankers or relationship manager.Very helpful tellersFriendly & efficient! Thank you Chase!Customer service was greatShould get a security deposit box systemNice and helpful staffAlways helpful7/11/2022 4:00 PM
Today I visited this bank, I took my son to open his account and I also wanted to ask for information about my card that has not yet arrived in my mail, previously the lady who attends when I entered told me that I needed it and I explained that I was going to open the account account of my son and that he needed information about my card and he told me that at 5:00 PM he closed but I arrived at 4:00 PM they still had an hour to attend and they had no clients I asked him if he could attend to me he told me that The one who was there to attend still had a person to attend to and I waited, at 4:09 minutes the young man named Josué Días came out and told me that he could not attend me and I told him I just want to open an account for my son and know of my card and he told me that he only attended by appointment, it had never really happened to me but this time I felt that both had not the slightest intention of attending me and the schedule says that they close at 5:00, it does not say that at 4 :00 PM they will no longer serve you I went to another Chase in the same way on Westheimer and I was very well attended and I was very satisfied 13311 Westheimer Rd Houston TX 77077 .
But I want to leave my experience that if they are not willing to serve the client then they should let them know and that they do not accept working for Chase I asked the young man before leaving what his name was to call chance and notify my bad experience and the Media his card that's why I know your name is Josué Días
I hope your attention to the public changes and you are more friendly oh customer service is definitely not your thingVery bad attention, I went to open an account and they told me that I could do it with only my current work permit, because I went to my appointment the next day and I couldn't because I didn't have a valid passport, they don't take into account the immigration status of the People, it is already very difficult to have a work permit in this country and at Chase they make everything more complicated... forget about this bank, very bad attention. attention..","Positives:

Recently, my mother and I had to take care of some business here. The wait wasn't long at all. We didn't get all the info we needed, but everything was eventually resolved.I’m posting 3 stars because I am a victim of I’d theft that began at this branch.  The 3 stars reflect the lack of good security measures on the part of the drive through tellers.  Chase needs to implement better measures to insure their customers aren’t robbed of their hard-earned savings!
The customer service I have received since discovering the theft has been phenomenal even though we are still working through it.
I don’t have access to any of my accounts/money, my bills are not getting paid and my anxiety is through the roof.Worst bank location ever.very BAD service,their atm’s are always broken or no cash.bad service! don’t waste your time.This has to be the worst Chase Bank branch. The tellers are incompetent literally . I was shortened of my money and lied to about it .Mala atención al público , Poor attention to the public, no one gives you instructions, hours to ask a question..All of Jp Morgan chase banks are unprofessional they all have attitudes they all are racist especially the ones in Katy and the one by riveroaks. More than half my family use to bank with them and everyone of them has closed their accounts. For all african Americans I suggest you do the same and anyone else who get the horrible customer service. Put you money into a bank that cares that's professional. I told my husband not to bank with them from the beginning. 2 weeks after he opened an account with them here comes a black doctor on the news suing them for not cashing her check because of the amount.  I tried to warn him, the next day he closes his account. I rather bank with Chime then Chase.They were flexible with me on my second form of i.d. They did verify my i.d. and worked with me.Don't deserve a star.

Chase as a whole has been going downhill for a while closing branches and removing service offerings. I have been a customer for over 20 years but I feel it's time to move on.Came to this bank looking for a notary services which they refuse to help me cause they want me to bring the letter already type.!
I had never do that before and had been bank client for more than 30 years .!
Hate to know my favorite branch on braeswood was closed.!By far the worst bank, I always go through the business drive lane and having to wait 20 minutes to get attended and I’m the only car there makes no sense.

Had to get some documents for a closed saving account WHICH i verified by speaking with Customer Service in the phone and the lady today Oct 12 915am didn't want to help because she had appointment and the people from the Appointment aren't even there. But if you come to open an account they do everything to help. DISGRACEFULUnlike the other Chase locations in the area, this is the only one where the ATMs always seem to work properly and never gets overly crowded. The other locations never seem to have enough employees to help the customers.I was very satisfied with the service. Mrs. Dema Rivera was very friendly and helpful.
She walked me through all the process and answered all my questions professionally.
Thanks again for everything.This place needs better management. Scheduled an appointment to open an account weeks ago and then while waiting for my turn manager comes to me and tells me that the person I’ve appointment with is in vacation! Why don’t I try online! There’s no one else to help me out. Good rewards for being a loyal customer to Chase for years!Just left Chase from opening a high school account for my child. The customer service was horrible. We stood in an empty lobby for 17 minutes before we were greeted. When I thanked her for finally greeting us, she said she thought we were in line….but there was no line. Do better Chase!I seriously cannot stand this chase bank here I don't know why I continue to do business they don't care about actually serving the people that hold money with them and when they cant help u the bankers are quick to apologize to you  and tell u have a wonderful day. I give up on this locationThey removed the ATMs from outside of the bank so now you have to go inside and there’s always a line; I just waited 15 minutes and ended up leavingTwo thumbs way up for this location. Mr. Eric the manger has outstanding customer service manners. I knew him for quite sometimes now and I have never seen him without a genuine smile and cheerful attitude with everybody.

Thank you!Today I went to the bank at 12:51 pm and I was there until 1:15 pm, my intention was to open an account, I couldn't because I lacked some requirements, but while the person who is explaining to me what I lack, I counted in my briefcase the money I was going to use to open the account, Upon returning to my business office, I look in my briefcase for the documents to make a folder to go back to the bank with the requirements to open the account, but in that moment I realized,That my money is not there, so I go to the bank and the person who helped me informs me that no one else has entered his module after me, Please, I ask to check the cameras to see what happened to my money, today is September 23, 2022; the least you want as a person is to be losing money, and it was more than $900 Between bills of different denominations, check-in time 12:51 p.m., check-out time 1:15 p.m. customer service module, I want to know what happened to my money, please check the cameras, thanksMr. Eric Pagsanjan is the best manager I have encountered. He solved a problem no other chase officer could. I tip my hat to him, he truly went above and beyond. If you have a problem no other branch can solve or they give you excuses, come to this location he will find a way to solve itBankers are extremely rude and only see clients by appointments only even if they are not doing anything they won’t help customers open an account. Customer service needs to improve at this location.My experiences was excellent  Thao smith  was so nice and she has  great costumer service!! Come ask for her she’s very helpful and niceChase is one of the best in customer service.Great customer serviceVery nice service....Bad staff attitude!You can get cash from outside devices in your car, very quickly! convenient!

496,Chase Bank,"11310 Chimney Rock Rd, Houston, TX 77035",Houston,"Most unpleasant chase experience I’ve ever had. As a chase customer for over 10 years, i’m definitely disappointed in the customer service. Their was a man who looked to be of Asian decent, seemed like a manager that was anything but helpful.Worst Chase branch! The banker that tended to me yelled saying shes already on the phone with internal chase claims but didnt know the name of the document to be emailed to the branch. I contacted chase claims via the customer line because in a prior phone call they told me to go to the branch and a banker would know what form to ask for. This banker was upset I was trying to help because the customer claims line KNEW the name of the document!Easy and fast transaction during lunch. Greeted at front, teller took care of me quickly.Branch manager Cmore is unprofessional. He think wearing jeans is a good attire. Plus long wait time.  And the glass doors is broken. Very bad area.I loved coming here, the two young men that have helped me before have provided great help. One of them is Jonathan and I don’t remember the other guys name but he’s been just as helpful. Today other people send me back and forth with false information. At first I was told the wait was an hour and I could return and get done what I needed. When I come back the older women with short hair tells me the guy can set up an appointment for me when previously the guy had told me he cannot set up an appointment for me. Then the lady tells me I can do what I need online and I tell her I understand that but I have questions that I need answers to so I need to speak with a person. She tells me to sit down and wait and I’ll get help. She comes a few minutes later tells me I can’t get help without an appointment and they can’t set an appointment for me. She again tells me to go online, something we already went over. So that tells me that these people don’t want to do their job. She asks if I have an account with chase already and then remembers that she can after all set an appointment for me. I left. I was made to feel like she did not want to help me. This isn’t the professionalism I have received at this branch before. Hopefully something can be done where you stop lying to people and be truthful upfront.Worse customer service . Wait for hour just for a question , and agents spending time in texting.I came to write a review and I already saw their poor rating. Well, it shows. They make me wait two days to get an appointment, tell me what I need to bring to the appointment, in an email, and I follow their directions. And on the day of the appointment, I still don't have the requirements needed (according to them). I brought my wife's green card, social security number, passport, and two forms of address verification. This branch might have the most incompetent staff in all of Chase, which says a lot. Joel Gonzalez was my personal banker; the guy knows nothing about his job. Even something routine like opening an account...what a waste of time and gas coming here. Never againEvery. Single. Time. I've decided to stop at this branch, there's been an issue with the drive-up ATMs. I'm usually driving past after they've closed for the day, so it's not like I can use the ATMs inside.I don't know about this bank we have cashed several checks before and one we cashed through moble app and it says it has to clear for 10 days does not make sense and so we called the customer that is on the check to just cancel it so they can pay a different way and he tells us his account shows they took the money out 2 days ago we have called and called and they all tell us it will show up the next day in our account  it's always the next day and it never does and then the ones in this bank location just want you to keep calling because they are to lazy to have time for customers really awful customer service on phone and in this location I'm going to cancel this bank and open with another bank this is rediculousSo it takes one week for an appointment to open up a business account. C’mon 😡 …Zero stars! Is this branch ran by a doctor...they open at 9:06. Took 30 minutes to deposit a check in the drive through.Phone service is not professional I try five times and couldn’t get anybody on the line at this branch automated system disconnect the call after five to seven minutes hold.Rocky was super helpful. Went above and beyond to help me out.Worst costumer service ever, they said they are busy but they are doing absolutely nothing!","Positives:

497,Chase Bank,"9704 Katy Fwy, Houston, TX 77055",Houston,"I absolutely love the people that work at this branch. I move the old Branch Manager. She was rude and was never helpful. I also felt her team worked hard at trying to keep the customer coming back.
So with out question hands down the are a 5 star team. The case she assistant manager or lead should be the branch manager she really cares and truly support her teller team memebers.Customer service told me to bring a receipt to branch to help push through money order , came to bank and they told me there’s nothing they can do. Seems like there’s a lot of employees that are either ill informed or just don’t want to do their jobs. Now the customer suffers, go figure!You can't see anyone without an appointment.
My time is limited and I need to speak with someoneAfter reading all the negative reviews I guess they changed the GM because I've been to this branch a couple of times recently & I was greeted & helped quickly & professionally. Jennifer took her time to sit down with me to sort out some things with my accounts.Went in to close a family member's account after they passed away. The guy didn't even express any condolences. Everything was just ""matter of fact"".

And by the way, when you have a family member pass away and Chase finds out, rather than freeze the account, they initiate a large transaction withdrawal and send out notices that the account is overdrawn.

So while you're dealing with a death in your family you also have to worry that someone has stolen that family member's identity. And to top it off you can't even talk to Chase until you have a certificate of death, which takes a few weeks.

Queue the announcer, ""Chase. We really care about your family.... family's money.""I was greeted up on entering and the customer service fellow was helpful at the window but if you need service from the workers at the desk - make an appointment ahead of time if you want to get something done quickly. Otherwise it'll be awhileMade me wait longer than the other customers who came after me, did not remove/reverse all the monthly fees.Don’t waste your time at this branch 3rd time in a row they always try not to help you useless always said they have nobody to help and is like 10 people working insideWorst service ever!They are informed that Chase kept my money, they closed my account without justification from last week until today, they do not give me an explanation where my money went, it sounds very bad but it is true and it is not the first time, now I don't know how solve utility payments because I had everything in the bank, what I'm seeing is unfair, they happen to see when they need to solve my problem 🤔🤔😥😥 I'm not a person to make comments like this but I had to do it so be careful, have money always in cash to be able to solve problems like this, if I love it, it has happened to me, don't let it happen to someone else.","Positives:
- Customers appreciate the friendly and helpful employees at the branch.
- There is praise for the assistant manager or lead who is seen as caring and supportive.
- Some customers had positive experiences with the customer service and quick assistance on their accounts.

Room for improvement:
- Some employees are perceived as rude, unhelpful, and ill-informed, which impacts the customer experience.
- There are complaints about the need for appointments and long wait times for service.
- Issues with fees not being removed and unequal treatment of customers.

Miscellaneous:
- One customer criticizes the bank for their handling of a deceased family member's account and identity theft concerns.
- Another customer expresses frustration with the bank closing their account without explanation and not providing assistance in solving the issue.

499,Chase Bank,"1118 Fry Rd, Houston, TX 77084",Houston,"This bank is sketchy, the drive through is abandoned. You have to go inside to withdraw money. It’s not busy right now, only 2 workers in the front and they’re taking their time.This location is horrible when it comes to finding a personal banker that actually available to talk to and resolve any issues you may have.  Either they ALL on lunch (hr) including the managers or on vacations it seems.  This particular location is only good for just depositing or withdrawing your money anything else you have to make a appointment or they just don't want to help you and use the everyone on break scheme.So after leaving the abandoned ATM at 9520 Homestead I thought surely this place would have an ATM as it is a branch. Again, the ATM was abandoned but this time boarded up, there were uncovered manholes in the parking lots nearby and I do not know if the branch operates at all (was over the weekend). Again, sad how the community is treated. No one should have to live around this.Outside ATM looks like an abandoned drive thru.  I couldn't get any money out.  I finally went inside and was limited far below my limit on what the machine would dispense.  Chase should be embarrassed of this branch.No longer an actual bank. Just an ATM.Manager and staff here are top notch. Without the managers help today I would be out of luck. God bless this location and staff.No ATMGreat customer service if you are a member or pay 10$ if notReally bad customer service.Helpful","Positives:

500,Chase Bank,"8536 Hwy 6 N, Houston, TX 77095",Houston,"These 5 stars are NOT for Chase Bank as a whole but for the very specific service and care taken by one employee, Lauren.
Chase Bank has been like a very frustrating spouse who promises but rarely follows through with immediate and precise action. The past 5 yrs as a customer has been traumatic to say the least.  I had actually visited 3 Chase Bank locations that DAY in hopes of finally meeting a Chase Rep. who would actually follow through and then my luck changed and Lauren said, ""May I help you?"" And help me she did. With papers in hand I explained my issue and within 5 days it was resolved. An issue I had been dealing with for weeks and weeks without so much as a return call.  She kept me updated, called back and asked questions to make sure the details were correct. I hadn't experienced this kind of Customer service from Chase since the late 90's. It felt great to actually be listened to appreciated and served. Great job Lauren.No drive thru, Only ATM outside. Inside you will find one teller helping a line of folks (6 to be exact) while every other employee is in their office surfing the net or pretending their hardest to appear busy.  Avoid this Chase.Worst customer service I have ever seen in any bank.  I would never recommend this location.  Chase Oak Forest.Fabulous service!!! Angelica is a wonderful, very professional person. She was extremely helpful and made things easy. Often banks can have illogical policies and cumbersome procedures . Angelica work through all this to help me with my issues. She surpassed the customer service I had received at the branch on 34th and Shepherd (those people are just plain RUDE). I highly recommend this branch!This is a high traffic location and the staff stays very busy.  I specifically want to recognize Janet G. and Angelique as they always makes time to help out no matter how busy it looks. Thanks!I had a frustrating morning but the management at this branch were finally able to resolve my problem. They also added a personal touch.

As I go went through the review for this Chase location it seemed kind of discouraging, but with me being who I am I wanted to see if I would experience the same as the negative reviews posted here.

First, I would like to say thank you having the availability that other locations did not, in order for me to come in and open my new account in a timely manner. As, I walked through the door you're greeted by beautiful respectful staff members, that are there ready to assist and to make sure you get the help you need. I was able to successfully open my new account with Chase, with no delay. Thank you Corey for taking the time to assist, and making sure that all my questions were answered. I was able to get everything completed before the hour. I was hungry at the time as well, so the speedy service was a plus in my book. LoL. This  location in my point of view, is diverse, respectful, everyone has a professional demeanor, clean and inviting, amazing customer service! Keep up the AMAZING WORK and don't let reviews stop you from being the GREATEST STAFF!!

Kindly,
Jocelyn MarieCustomer service is better now. Odiesieas took his time and help us professionally and take really good care of us. I just wish the teller line is faster as the other side. But all in all great experience.Unprofessional, unorganized I sat an appointment to open an account and when I walked in the workers told me that I didn’t call and needed to make another appointment. While being in there for 45 mins I was unable to open the account because the banker did not know what he was doing and deleted my information out the system.My 22 year old daughter just came home from college and wanted to cash all of the US savings bonds she's received from her grandmother over the years. She also needed to open a new checking account. The teller at Chase told us you have to have an account with Chase for 2 YEARS in order to cash US SAVINGS BONDS. Then he told us our only option was to go to PLS Check Cashing place. How ridiculous. We went to Bank of America....they opened the account, deposited the bonds (at the current payout) and some of it was available immediately. On a SATURDAY. Chase. Fail. BOA...amazing service.ATMs don't work. Card gets stuck at ATM and you can't withdraw money. Staff Is aware of problem and has done nothing. Lazy incompetent staff can't even put up a sign on the machine that says out of order.Chase has too many customers and can’t do what they promised.

No need to speak to an actual person, which I really liked 😅.I deposited my payroll check this Sunday and was notified that I wouldn’t get my money until the 15th. I never use this bank I use Chase in the Heights and have deposited my checks for three years now and never had any problems. It cost me two hours of pay to go in and try to fix this Monday morning. they said there was nothing I could do about it and I would get my money today even though on my receipt it says the 15th. It’s still has not been deposited in my account. This Banks ATMs never work are always out of order. I don’t know if that’s because it’s in the east end which is a poorer part of town than the Heights. I am 72 years old . i deposited over $1000 payroll check and I have a -$14 Account. The bank I normally use by my work is in the Heights on Washington. For three years I’ve never had any problem. When I deposit my check I get the full amount in my account automatically.

505,Chase Bank,"7803 Long Point Rd, Houston, TX 77055",Houston,"The Manager yesterday was a young African American lady i didn't get her name was horrible..... She didn't cash the check i came in to cash from a law firm that Chase does a lot of business with... She didn't call the law firm to clear the check or anything... She flagged my ID without telling me and created a huge problem for me ... Had to spend 2hours this morning at a different branch to get everything resolved.... I will never go to the Chase on Montrose location again... Never have i ever been treated so bad and rude at any bank in my life...Can’t say enough about Chase banker John Mullin. Some crooks stole my checkbook and wrote $9000+ in fraudulent checks. JOHN stayed an hour late to help me and then the next day followed up and got my money back in my account 48 hours after the whole thing happened. Typically it could take up to five business days on something like this to recoup your loss. Chase has a dream employee in him. Thank you, John!This location seems to have an issue keeping their drive thru machine touchpad working, and don't put a sign or block drive  and then you have to wait and wait and wait to get your card back when it finally times out..It's been a wonderful experience banking at Chase because they offer veterans a special account. They have helped me when my account was compromised they were right there to help me.I was in the area for an appointment and went to get a document notarized. I have notarized this particular type of document for years with no issues until today. The notary and staff was looking for every reason under the moon to not notarize my document. They kept attempting to make small talk to figure out why I was 45 minutes from my home and came to this bank which doesn’t matter. They ask me if I have a business account with them which doesn’t matter. I have been to Regions, BofA, Chase and UPS to get this document notarized numerous time with no issues. From the moment I walked in the door at this bank they were on high alert. The notary says she’s done this for a long time but she researching google on what she should do. Laughable.This place is rude from the drive through, broken ATMs and now extremely inconsiderate of others time. I had an appointment with Renisha, she called me 30 minutes before our meeting to talk about the appointment which I made clear what I was looking for, as I have been there for the same reason with no problems in January. I come in and waited turns out Renisha left sick, could have said something but Ok I was given Joshua , however he was unable to do anything my appointment was made for. It was obvious Renisha was only hearing me instead of listening as she completely miscommunicated everything to Joshua. I made time to be able to make this appointment happen and it was a wasted. If there is going to be one banker available for the whole chase make sure they can do everything what is the point of having someone there that can only do a portion of work? Thanks for wasting my timeThis branch is the most unhelpful branch of chase I’ve ever visited.

506,Chase Bank,"7545 Bellfort St, Houston, TX 77061",Houston,"I ve always had an amazing experience, every time I come to this location. Ms. Christiana, Mr. Nick, Ms. Nusrat and I think all the staff at this location are very helpful. Thank you for all that you do for us.I had an issue with my account that only going into the bank branch could resolve. When I arrived, the line was almost to the door, but I was pleasantly surprised when I was greeted and asked what type of transaction I was there for. Once I explained my situation I was told to take a seat. I only had to wait about 10 minutes before I was helped. The bank rep was very professional and quickly gave me options to alleviate the situation. Great customer service!Went there to open a business account and experienced Very bad customer service by GilAs a private client customer I usually get really good service here.I came here do a busienss deposit. There was no line so I was in and out pretty quickly. The teller as very nice.Very nice bank but Horrible customer service.I was helped by Patrick Pryce and wow he had the best customer service !!!! I recommend anyone going to this location to ask for him. He was able to answer all of my questions, he helped me open my checking account with chase and answered all my questions about my business account. He was beyond nice, patient and very knowledgeable. I will definitely be coming back to this location for any service I may need. Thank you so much Mr. Pryce !!!!!Thanks Christian Garcia Centeno for your help. You demonstrated great customer service and thanks for listening.Poor Service. They send you promotions to open account and maintain to redeem the promotion. And finally when its time to redeem they say the employee forgot to apply coupon and nothing can be done. Would request the management to look into it and resolve.Chase bank is like family bank, we get warm reception, see smiling faces, located in the most convenient area and altogether, great service, feel be with the family.Very bad Customer service we wait one hour to see the bankerStay away! 20 people in the line and only 2 of them working…Benjamin Ayala is very helpful, professional, kind and understanding. He gave his all to explain and understand things I had no clue about. Will definitely recommend family and friends to this location with Mr. Ayala!!!I've been with Chase for a year now and I am very satisfied with their service. It's a great bank and the people at the branch on Wilcrest are so friendly. I would recommend Chase to anyone needing a good solid established bank.I literally wouldn’t even give this bank a star. The 1 atm they do have never works. And the building is so big. Yet it’s a Bank of America atm across the street that ALWAYS work. Make it make sense chaseI have been with Chase for over 50 years and they have always delivered for me.I need to have my documents notarized so I went to Chase, there I was served by Ms. Sylvie TRAN.
Unfortunately for me and for her that Ms. has no smile, no eye contact,  grouchy, impolite language. Ms. Tran is not a good image for Chase Bank.
Very unfortunate!Power outage at this place can't even go see the safe deposit box.Teller Adriana attended me with no smile on her face. She didnt greet me at all. Kept Yawning and clearly wanted to go home.My daughter and I were in town for an event at Sugarland and we had wonderful service with Mr. Chu. He was kind and very helpful.What is going on with their drive thru ATM??? One is always broken and removed the other three! Make it make sense!The atm took my money and they have to do an investigation about my money I will be closing my account immediately after they fix this issueNo ATM access outside business hour. DriThru amt brokenGreat customer serviceChaseIncompetent staff. They do not give you an explanation of why the account is phantom expensesVery good Sadie Benítez treated me very professionally, she explained everything to me 👍I do not recommend anyone because they have no information and they told me that they closed my account, I cannot be with them anymore, they voted for me, they kicked me out","Positives:

507,Chase Bank,"6816 Capitol St, Houston, TX 77011",Houston,"I opened up a business account and was charged all these hidden fees. I came in to cancel my account and the manager just tells me to proceed to a teller without even asking why am I trying to cancel or tried to come up with a solution to the problem.  Everytime I come they are short on staff or I have to make an appointment for a week to 2 weeks. I asked to speak to a manager and she was so careless and said ok well close your account and rudely grabs my business card and cut it with the scissors without even trying to waive the simple $10 hidden fee. Never seen a bank so unprofessionalATM’s literally never work, a waste of peoples time. Just go to an other branch if you want to use Chase.Every time you come here the ATM machines are not working. This happens every day. I need to deposit my paycheck. I am handicap, I can't walk in to the bank, l depend on the ATM machines to do all of my banking. At all hours of the day the machines ate down. It doesn't matter which machine it was. A lot of the depositors are frustrated because of this. The ATM machines need to working for all the people. I'm ready to close my account. I'm tired of this situationI give this location 20 zeros people need to get it together here ATMs always down it's ridiculous somebody needs to do something about it I will go to corporateI bank with them on my personal account and have had no issue, the only reason why I’m rating them 1 star is because I always do drop off’s and change deposits for my job. We always get our change wrong and they forgotten to give me my ID (and then blame me for it, the first time) on 2 occasions alreadyIt has been months maybe years that this bank doesn’t have all their ATMs functioning. So you have to drive or walk to the three different ATM locations at this same site to find a working ATM. It is not a well-lit bank location either. I do think they’re to blame for the environment they create that is conducive to crime. I have never felt safe going to this bank’s ATMs. I hope that they realize they’re also responsible for the death of innocent Arlene Alvarez; and I pray the Alvarez family can get justice from Chase too. It is not difficult to have all ATMs working, to make sure all lighting is working, or to have working cameras or security in place; that is the minimum a bank should be offering.Gave my mother very bad customer receive, they told her to wait 30 mins to an hour which she was willingly doing before they rudely asked her what she wanted and why she wanted to open up a bank account and that she didnt need to open a bank account after.In the last 3 days, the ATM machines have not worked or even been turned on (and there's 6 ATM machines total). Absolutely ridiculous, and I've been going to this bank since 2015Justice for Arlene Alvarez 💜😇 May God bless your family

- stop banking with Chase, they don’t value there customers, and this location ISN’T SAFE! …The one time I need to use the bank..Drive thru ATMs never available when I come by.All my friends and family closed their account,  0 start for this bank.

She was sweet and verified everything for me. Will be back and have her assist!If you have a chase prepaid card from a plasma center your personal information will be sold to scammers.. Friend you have been warnedTerrible customer service. We had an appointment with a Jose Cerrato and he was extremely rude. He kept speaking over us and cutting us off in mid-sentence as if he was in a hurry for something else. He showed no care in helping us. If you don’t want to deal with folks like this, you’d be better off taking your business at a different location.Every time I show up, all the ATM's are always out of order, this chase needs an EXTREME makeover!The atm literally never dispenses cash and it’s a 50/50 chance it’s gonna except deposits.

510,Chase Bank,"2900 Woodridge Dr, Houston, TX 77087",Houston,"The last 3 times I have been to this branch, the system has been down. Can only use ATM. Had to go all the way home to get ATM card. This past time I had to log put of one ATM and then into another because the only cash they had was only $100 bills. All they say is 'sorry'  but yet they are continually calling me to get me to let them manage my money in investments. No way! If they can't manage the simple things, why would I think they would do a good job of investing my money.something as simple as fixing the door access to the atm after hour is not done. We have to use the drive true because they lock the system after hour to the atm inside so guess what you have to wait in line.fix the door to the main entrance and give us access after ours to the atm inside it is safer.....They are soooooo slow! I have to do deposits several times a week for my job. I use the drive through.They have a business lane and 2 ATM lanes. The business lane is not really for business customers. It doesn't matter if I'm the only 1 in line or 3rd. It always take at the least 15 min. I can't be away from my office for more than 30 min. I'm always late getting back.Rude and inconsiderate of people’s time. Repeatedly, this location would not inform their customers that the banker has left or would not be available and only do so after making people wait for at least 30+ minutes. While they’re understandably short staffed, they disregarded people’s time and just chatted with each other while we waited. After waiting, they’ll say they help you make an appointment. I’d agree to that if the employee hadn’t immediately left us in the middle of the lobby and began chatting with another customer about her jewelry for another 5 minutes.Laverne the supposed manager is very unprofessional and should not be in this position she could not even show her face for a simple question. She relayed a message to have me wait 48 minutes and never came around to talk to me. I am a customer. Appts all made by app they cannot answer any questions. Absolutely ridiculous quit using Covid as an excuse we are customers and we need help.I was there today and Leah assisted me she was very good, helped me with all requirements, there l  was little big line too but she took her time and didn’t rush to me very nice customer service.I don't have any issue with the people who work here, but this location seems to always have some part of their systems down.If I can give this branch a -star I will. This branch has the worst customer service the lines are long and they don’t care. How do they still have a job there. I have been banking  with Chase for many years and it was always a pleasure going to the bank and asking for help with any questions or card issue my family and I had. One of my daughters just turned 18 not to long ago and she received  a new card in the mail, and she didn’t remember her pin. I got off work and took her to reset her pin at this branch, the teller that first helped us wanted us to wait on the next window because that window was the only one in the whole bank that can reset the pin!! Really ! I said no I’m not waiting at that window because the customer that was there before us had been there for a while with that teller. I asked the teller if someone else could help me she replied I’m sorry no.. The customer finally finished and left I was then attended by another teller, this teller asked if my daughter had an id I said yes a school id, she said no a government id I told her she recently turned 18, but I have my id and she’s under my account and I explained it was a high school account. The teller said she couldn’t reset the pin and for me to call the customer service number and they can issue her a pin via mail. Where is the logic in that when in the customer service line they don’t see me and they can’t verify my credentials, but in a branch where they can see me and verify could not help me!! Very unprofessional this branch made me reconsider if I still want to continue banking with chase all together.Excellent, ladies are so sweet and the they pay attention to help me in everything.. thanks.There is a reason at this bank is only rated two stars in their reviews. This is one of the worst Chase banks in the area. They have some of the most raggediest and broken down ATMs of anywhere. Every time I pull into use their ATMs outside they always have a sign on them saying they're not working or can't dispense cash. Today I tried to use the outside ATM and it was not working so I parked and came inside, there was a long line at the ATM in the lobby so I went inside the branch to use that ATM and it had the same sign on it. So they basically had one working ATM and they only had one teller open. Ridiculous! I've talked to the manager of this branch about 6 months ago regarding the ATMs always being out of service and he said they were managed by a third party and they would work on it. Nothing has changed!I came to this location today around 1:50PM as I had a problem with my credit card, the two ladies behind the desk  ( Leah and her co-worker) were really helpful and provided  a High Level  of customer service, all locations should be like this .Horrible service and terribly rude banker. I went with my mom to translate for her to make some simple changes to her bank account. The banker that assisted us was Kevin Pang. As soon as he saw the status of my mom he immediately asked if she had her “green card”. First of all it’s called a RESIDENCY. Nobody even uses that term anymore unless you’re a racist. He just kept referring back to that term and saying he couldn’t make any changes without further identification, when they clearly can see her status on her account. So don’t go to this bank unless you want to be treated like a piece of garbage.The staff at this bank is so rude and unprofessional it’s ridiculous. I have to go to another branch just to conduct my business. I love chase bank and the services they provide. This  branch along with quite a few in Houston TX needs some attention in customer service…The reviews do not shock me regarding poor customer service. The banking center manager was snarky and rude in front of many people. I see the customer service standards in banking have slipped.The clear tank tome like laugh olmos y hit meWorst location everrrrrrrrr. I had to remove myself from an account, and they said they only have one banker and that he's booked solid and I have to come back and make an appointment that this takes a long time. Then they said that the other person had to be present. Then they said they didn't have to be present. Then they said it takes 30 min, mind you, my sister just did it at another branch and she said it was 5 min. It shouldn't be this hard to remove yourself from a location. The icing on the cake was they said the guy was booked solid... I turn around and he's giggling with another colleague... yeah he's BOOKED 🙄 I've been banking with Chase for over 25 years, this interaction, lack of customer service and care has made me decide to move all of my accounts to a credit union.They need more workers at this bank… seems like no one is working at the drive thru and it’s open… took at least 10 minutes for someone to come to the window…Very friendly employees greeted me when I entered the bank. I had a scheduled meeting with John Nguyen that went very well.Only one drive thru line that takes forever and they took out one of the drive up ATM while the other one is always down.Bank Tellers know my name upon entering as well are kind ladies working there .Always busy and no one around to help! The counter ladies are useless for information when asked.Even Thea not respond In the phone","Positives:
- Leah provided excellent customer service and was helpful.
- Some employees are friendly and greet customers upon entry.
- John Nguyen conducted a successful scheduled meeting.
- Bank tellers know the names of customers upon entering.
- The counter ladies are kind.

Room for improvement:
- The system has been down on multiple occasions, causing inconvenience for customers.
- The bank should have more working ATMs and ensure they dispense cash properly.
- The drive-thru service is slow and needs more staff.
- The staff should be more considerate of customers' time and provide accurate information about wait times and availability of services.
- The branch should improve communication with customers and inform them if bankers are unavailable.

Miscellaneous:
- The supposed manager, Laverne, is described as unprofessional.
- Some employees, like Kevin Pang, are rude and use inappropriate language.
- Some customers have had negative experiences with customer service and regard the branch poorly.
- The location needs attention in terms of customer service standards and staff availability."
511,Chase Bank,"619 Timberdale Ln, Houston, TX 77090",Houston,"I come to this location almost daily, I am always greeted by my name in the window or the tubes. The ladies and gentlemen working here are always so nice and give fast service. I am shocked reading all these 1 star reviews. No job is easy and not stressful. I think they are doing a great job.What I'm going to say isn't just about this Chase bank, but other ones in my neighborhood. Why are so many Chase ATM's aren't working? I've been to a number of their ATM's and they're either broke down or you have to wrestle with some of them to work right, why? When is Chase going to get on the ball and fix their machines? You have commercials bragging about how good it is to be with Chase, when you have broken ATM's, I know you guys can do better than that, c'mon now, really? This is ridiculous.🤨Well I like this Chase Bank very much really I do. They are nice it’s a clean Bank, but to my dismay and great disappointment today ( just now) they sent not only my bank card but my drivers license to the wrong person in the drive thru!! Not only did I get someone else bank deposit slip of over $7000! they saw my picture which is not bad lol but my ADDRESS too!! I’ve been really sick these past few days and now add worried as if we all didn’t have anything else to worry about!! DO BETTER WITH SECURING OUR INFORMATION CHASE. Pay better attention to what your doing if you can’t multitask DONT do it then.After a failed 4th attempt to open an account at the location on wallisville I called this location and I was encouraged to come and wait for the next round of appointments for a  no show, so they could assist me. I came here and sure enough the next round of app one did no show up and they help me right away … I was really pleased to see that they wan to stay busy and want to help prospective clients other locations should stop hiding behind appointments to turn customers away.The drive-thru  🏧  machines are a nightmare. Just recently had one of two 🏧  removed, and the other is non-working. They could at the very least left a message on the screen stating out of order, at least the 🏧 inside the business building between the front doors and the lobby works, except the card reader doesn't so your left with no banking service after hours.  What a damm joke!Has to be one of the worst chase banks in all of Texas. I tried to avoid coming here at all cost. Always something with the atms always a long line. I’ve been banking with chase since I was in high school but bottom line. Try to avoid coming to this chase if there not open.We opened our personal and business accounts with Omar Olivares, he was honestly one of the best bankers I’ve ever worked with. He was very patient and explained everything transparently. My parents are older and have health issues, and are not well versed in technology, he was very accommodating and understanding of there issues. Just wanted to share my amazing experience with him.This location really needs to fix the inside lobby ATM access. It's been ""broken"" for months and can't access it after hours or when the drive thru ATMs are super full!!!!. This is really inconvenient and needs to be fixed ASAP.Worst customer service ever the manager at this bank mr. Efrain Ruiz is very rude & they don't like staying a few minutes after closing he told me to hurry up and finish writting my claim # letter because it was already 2pm on a Saturday. not helpful in any way whtasoever his empleyes come to him for questions and he is just at clueless as they are and just says ""idk shouldn't there be a number you can call"" at this point I feel like anyone can become manager at that place . I would recommend to get a different bank or at least go to a different placeBeen here multiple times. Everytime I go it's on a Saturday. It always takes 20+ minutes to see a teller. Management doesn't do anything about getting extra tellers? Mismanaged location!

Update: came to this location a couple more times recently in the last time I waited 30 minutes in line to make a payment. There were over 15 people waiting in line with only two tellers. And then they have three or four staff members standing in the lobby just gossiping and not doing anything. Poor management. Corporate needs to fix this location.nothing works you can't even enter machine doesn't accept cardDrive thru ATM never worksI went today to open an account and Ms. Alise Mena was very helpful. She answered all my questions and has good customer serviceAlways fine when they have my moneyOn a Saturday n non of the atm work how's that possibleATMs never work and can't use the inside one because the card scanner on the door doesn't work eitherATM machines never work and the door to the ATM in the building never opens the door....😤 …Omar is super helpful and a pleasure to work with.Bad with appointments. At least Omar is.Really unorganizedThey closed my account, I asked the reason and they didn't tell me the reason.It's a holiday, September 5, and the ATM is closedThe ATMs are never in service; They are always failing, they should put new ATMs.The ATM never worksExcellent bank I am very happy with the service they give meExcellent customer service very friendly ErikaVery kind people 👏🏻","Positives:

512,Chase Bank,"11220 Fondren Rd, Houston, TX 77096",Houston,"I been long time chase customer here at this location.  Based on my account I qualify for free safe box but it been 5 years they still don't have available.  Soon I am closing my account.  Very useless service they provide to their customers.Don't expect good customer service. My handicapped mother was refused service because she doesn't have an account even though I do, and my name was on the document needing to be notarized. Wasted her energy (she can barely walk) and time.We were sent here after a banker from a branch (Sagemont) we normally goes to said she cannot help us notarize our Vietnamese passport renewal applications since she can't read Vietnamese, which I completely understood. She was kind enough to call this branch and we were INFORMED that the Scarsdale branch has a Vietnamese bankers available to assist us and we just needed to drive to the Scarsdale one.

Once entered, the front door rep greeted us. I could tell that the vibe here is completely different. Front rep was coming in and out of the back office. She did let us know that the banker we were waiting for was busy and should get with us. I noticed most of the time, no one is actually standing there to greet incoming customers. After ten minutes, an employee in the left area with an office came and talked to us and she did grab another customer in for wire transfer. We waited for an additional ten minutes before I went back to the line and asked if they the person we are waiting for are available or not since I had to get back to work.

After a few trips back and forth trip to the back and her desk, the banker (whom I assumed that's the person we were waiting for) confirmed with us that she was finishing up with a client and should be ready with us. Yikes, her attitude and facial expression was nasty and unwelcoming. I could tell that she was unhappy that I came up and asked about the wait.

Once she finished with her client, she grabbed both my mom and I in her cubicle. We sat down and I said we would like to have some papers notarized. She ask what is it, and I told her it was Vietnamese Passport Renewal. She immediately looked at forms and said ""Don't understand"". She explained that she cannot notarize anything that she doesn't understand. Hmmm, seriously - if you cant read Vietnamese fluently why wouldn't you inform us prior to all the wait. We came here because we were told the Vietnamese bankers could help with Vietnamese papers. Plus, all we needed was for her to confirm/verify the pictures on the forms was my mom and a witness of my mom's signatures. I am fluent as a 5th grader in Vietnam and I could understand almost everything in the forms. For her to said she doesn't understand made us unsatisfied with her work (the kindest way I would describe it).

Worst all of these was her attitude and unwelcoming facial expressions.Misplaced my cards and b4 I ordered new ones, I stop in the Scaresdale location. Cathy the clerk came out to help me download the necessary app and add it to my phone! She waited to help me make sure what i needed to do was All correct and made the whole process easy to understand! Thanks Cathy!I often go here to deposit checks because it’s close to San jac, the ladies here are super friendlyThe staff is very rude and unprofessional at the counter.Poor drive threw service …Fast and friendly.","Positives:
- Close proximity to other locations
- Friendly staff at the San Jac branch

514,Chase Bank,"13706 East Fwy, Houston, TX 77015",Houston,"I came here to use Chase ATM in the lobby. Easy to find. I was in and out pretty quick. Plenty of parking.I’ve been visited this branch more than 5 years and I am always welcomed by everyone here. Works were done so fast and accurate. Recently, Cindy helped me a lot for making a credit card. Hope this help for your visit.
Thanks.Slowest bank ever! Waited 20 mins for a simple money withdrawal. Not a good representation of chase at all.The relationship manager, last name Ventura is a racist. I’m a black man and as soon as I walked in, she had an attitude. She clearly didn’t want to, nor know how to help me apply for a business credit card. After trying for 15 minutes, she goes and helps someone else for 10 minutes, only to come back and have no clue what she’s doing.

Horrible customer service.This bank branch is not crowded at all. I was the first in line when I came at 9am and was told that people usually come in after 11am. Rosie Andrade attended to me and she is very helpful and friendly. My experience with Chase has always been very good.I came in to get a paper notarized and although there were approximately five employees in the bank, I’ve sat here now for 15 mins on my lunch break waiting for someone to help me.

Absolutely poor customer service and I would not recommend this location. They said I had to wait because they ‘run off appointments’, absolutely just sad.No outside ATM and the after hours card reader does not work on the front door","Positives:
- Easy to find Chase ATM in the lobby.
- Quick service, in and out pretty quick.
- Plenty of parking.
- Friendly and welcoming staff.
- Fast and accurate work.

515,Chase Bank,"10997 Scarsdale Blvd, Houston, TX 77089",Houston,"Just opened an account online then deposited money while waiting for my direct deposit. Took over a week for that to show up. Now I deposited a check in person and its taking awhile to clear. I’m definitely not impressed and will be switching banks asap.I saw a bunch of bad reviews for this branch . I went in this morning and everyone was kind and helpful. I would definitely recommend this branch. 5 stars for sureSlowest bank in town. Business lane has been broke down for weeks!The line was long to talk to an teller to deposit a large amount . So the chase employee had an attitude with me saying I have to go to the ATM to deposit. I didn't feel comfortable as I told her, she was like really rude. I been with Chase for 26 years I will never go back to that location.My car keys were STOLEN by someone who worked there. I went there to deposit into my account & got my keys stolen. They refused to review the cameras & gave myself & brother a really hard time. They were extremely rude, unwelcoming and didn’t treat me like the paying customer I am. I will never return & I will be closing my account after today. Very inconsiderate & they didn’t care at allIt’s in a terrible location the drive way is shared with Starbucks and always hard to get into Chase bank. A big inconvenienceBad customer service. ATM takes $20 bills and doesnt give deposit in your accounts.Both times I’ve come to this location I haven’t been assisted today as I sit here no one is available to help me if this is a short staff issue someone should look into it.Out if all the chase banks I go to this is the worst service anyone can get.Been here 3 times trying to open an account. 1St was because it was too close to closing time now is that they have no appointments available for the next monthThis Chase Branch is amazing, everyone is always willing to help you with the best attitude. This is my go to branch all the time.This location seems to be very understaffed. The wait time is entirely too long. Please hire more people.Courtesy, location, convenient.

516,Chase Bank,"9335 Katy Fwy, Houston, TX 77024",Houston,"Main problem at this location is the ATM service. They have two outside but for some reason only one works. They also have one inside but after hours you don't have access to it becuase the card reader to go inside is always out of services. Which causes very long lines.If I could give zero stars I would, by far the worst chase bank in all of Houston area, the atm never works. I suspect they intentionally program them to start glitching out because this is happening every day. I think the last time I was able to pull cash successfully from here was 4 months agoTrudy Bonito deserves a raise. She’s the current branch manager at this location.
I visited this location to inquire about a business loan.

Mrs Bonito took the time to explain all of the available business credit cards available and other resources.

This branch has a very close community approach. I felt very welcomed.

Be mindful of the time of day that you visit. Some hours can be very busy. Between 3:30-4:30 is very busy. Especially Saturday for obvious reasons.

Chase bank is a wonderful bank to bank with. Their app also allows you to check your credit. Any questions regarding credit, they will definitely assist you.2 🏧 one always broken always long line to get to the ATM you would think they would try to always keep both atm working in high traffic area. …Made an appointment to take care of two things a week ahead. The first thing was addressed with 10 minutes and then wanted to open an additional account with chase but the bank clerk said it would take 45-60 minutes to do even tho I had 35+ minutes left on my reservation still available. Was told to make a new reservation for another week. I was shocked and couldn’t believe this lack of customer experience. Pretty much wasted a weeks time and wanted to cancel my other chase account completely because of this. Quite possible the worst customer experience and lack of understanding I’ve ever experience at a bank. I would give them 0 stars if I could. Ridiculous.

FYI, went to another chase bank branch 5 miles down the road and they took me as a walk in instantly and opened my additional account in less than 20 minutes. Luckily that branch was able to help me swiftly or else I would have gone to a completely different bank altogether.

Edit. Went here recently again because I didn’t have a choice. Customer service still SUCKS.Only 1 drive thru atm so major long lines and the indoor atm’s can’t be used since it won’t open the doors when trying to unlock with your card.ATM lines are ridiculously long only 1 ATM machine works during non business hours you would think they had at least 2 or we had access to the one at at the entrance at least.They taking forever to open. It's 9:20 already.Went to four chase banks an none of them got bankers to do paperwork for withdrawal  $$$$By far the worst.  One ATM for all customers.  This bank has purposely denies access to the ATM inside after hours.  The wait for an ATM transaction is literally 30 minutes!Actual garbage bank branch. Walk in ATM’s break constantly. You are then forced to use the drive thru service for simple transactions.Always 1 atm working wish they would add more or least have them all working.Only one ATM working it doesn't make no sence ! 🤦🏽‍♀️ …This bank is the worst, being a bank and it does not have money to be able to fix its machines, all the time its machines are out of order, I do not understand if the manager does not know or assumes that the machines do not work, avoid this bank please!trying to called the bank so many times never wanted to pick upOne atm, the one inside is locked..I’d give the bank a 0 star if I could.WORST CHASE BANK IN ALL HOUSTON !!!
The ATM machines are always down !

517,Chase Bank,"7007 Fannin St, Houston, TX 77030",Houston,"This morning I went to chase, which is in Sabo. I was attended by a lady (she seemed Asian) I only went to cash a check, she had a bad attitude, then she told me that my check was not appearing in the system, I have been working in the company for 14 years and for the first time time the check does not appear in the system. I called my company and they told me that it was not possible, so she told me the check is in the system. In truth, banks are disappointing us more and more, now I have to go to another bank to change my check, there is no point in going back there.  I think that if she had wanted to help, we would have called the company to solve the problem. If I would have the option to put 0 stars that will put.My son has a Chase account.  He deposited a live paycheck into his account.  They froze his entire account, not only the check, but all monies in his account. He cannot withdraw anything he had in the account before the deposit. They said there was a fraud alert on the company check due to his company changing their dba.  Regardless as to the fact that the check cleared.  Chase refuses to give my son access to his funds before the check in his account. THIS IS THEFT.Came inside to do a withdrawal from the atm, didn’t get the money but a number to call, the person sitting next to the atm’s is not helpful at all, the booth person rude as well, so when I tried to get the money that was marked as withdraw from the account, after they put it back she’s questioning which atm did you use? Because that one on the right ( Which I used)has been having issues, use the other one, so I asked the lady sitting next to atm’s why don’t you put a sign that this atm is not giving any money out? She’s like oh no we can’t do that because you can still make deposits on it, OH LORD!!! Wouldn’t be easier to type a sign with that information? Instead of wasting time at your unfriendly window?Great place with great people.  They manage both my personal and business banking.  It is popular so sometimes there is a wait.

Also it was conveniently super close to home. 10/10 she was dope and the place was really chill.None of the outside atms worked and my card would not let me in the atm in the frontThe ATMs have trouble accepting cash and they lock the foyer doors (where the indoor ATM is located at) after hours.

Sue is the teller that usually takes care of me. She is awesome. There are a couple of other tellers, unfortunately I don’t know their names. I had an issue cashing a Chase issued check at another branch. I had a meeting with an associate. When I arrived, he was on a lunch break. Not a problem for me. Everyone has to eat. Another associate helped me. He was only started 2 weeks ago. He gave me a solution or I thought he had. I had to go back to the previous bank to cancel the endorsement. After I did that, I went back to Sue. Sue was very cordial and gave me a phone number to call to get me a solution . Thank you Sue. Keep up the great work. It is certainly appreciated.This is worst Chase bank branch. The associates never ever greet you rather chit chat with each other. They were standing together and I asked for some cash withdrawal with the different denominations. The lady who was an associate manager told me there is an atm you can go and get it yourself. She was very rude. I never had such experience in my life. This has happened multiple times. Don’t ever expect a better service from this branch. We hardly visit any branch due to the online services availability. The next time I visited to get the passport related documents notary, the concerned was never interested to sign them.

I made an appointment WEDNESDAY to open a checking account today Thursday 10/12/23 with Michael. When I told the teller with the Black lipstick(very unprofessional look for representation of a bank), that I had an appt at 1:30 she said Oh with Michael. Looks around and says Since you were a couple minutes behind he took A Walk In Customer. I looked down at my phone it was 1:33. No Wonder This Branch Is Closing. The level of unprofessionalism here is sad and ridiculous. I will not be opening a checking account or a business account.If you are going to shut down a branch temporarily let people know ahead of time and maybe when you might reopen. Your drive through is ridiculous, why is it that the business line and ATM's are the only open lines. Really you guys are so frustrating!! Clean up your act, the only reason we go there is because my 80 year old mother doesn't want to go through the headache of changing banks.

522,Chase Bank,"13311 Westheimer Rd, Houston, TX 77077",Houston,"I just want to report a lady by the name of Shelley Paul  for having a racist attitude,
We were waiting for a banker to be available to ask a question about my account.
This lady saw that we were next and a white young man was barley coming into the door and she asked him how can I help you?
Than we said excuse me we just have a quick question, then she replied. Do you have an appointment? Than we said no . she said you need to make an appointment. So we had to go to another chase to make a simple question.
If someone in chase sees this please pay attention to this lady
Thanks 🙏My recent visit to the Chase Bank in Summerwood on August 26th, 2023, was nothing short of frustrating and disappointing. The experience left me deeply dissatisfied, and I feel compelled to share my thoughts.

Upon entering the bank, I was immediately struck by the lack of personal assistance available. There was no one present to attend to customers or guide anyone.

It was also alarming to see that the bank had only one banker on duty during a Saturday visit.
It's perplexing that a bank as prominent as Chase would have such limited personnel available during what is typically a busy day for customers.

The culmination of these issues has left an indelible mark on my perception of this particular Chase Bank location. I find it disappointing that a bank of Chase's stature would provide such subpar customer service!

In light of this visit, I regret to say that I have no intention of returning to this specific Chase Bank branch. The level of service provided was far below acceptable standards, and it's clear that there is a need for substantial improvements in customer care, staff availability, and overall operational efficiency.

It is my hope that this review reaches both the bank's management and potential customers. I believe that transparency is crucial for the improvement of services, and I sincerely hope that Chase Bank takes the necessary steps to rectify these glaring issues. As customers, we deserve better than what was experienced during this regrettable visit.Chase bank is a complete joke, going on 4 weeks now of trying to recover my $3,500 funds from a wire fraud scam.  The supervisor from the executive office is rude and telling me everything they can't do instead of helping me recover my funds.  The initial representative from Chase improperly advised me, as had they done what they were supposed to I wouldn't even be in this situation.  Everyone at Chase gives different information and just an overall nightmare.
Don't bank with them your money is not safe at Chase!I made an appointment for October 1 to have two documents notarized and to remove my deceased mother's name from the accounts. When I called Chase on August 15, I was told that I needed to submit the death certificate and bring my identification to a branch. Since I am based in Southwest Missouri now, there are no branches within 100 miles that I could drive to. Therefore, I booked a flight to Houston, Texas to attend to the matter. I met with Camilla. She then tells me that she cannot remove my mother's name because my father needs to be present to sign. I was not given that information and my father is in a nursing home in Missouri. If I had known, I would have walked with the power of attorney. She said he still needed to sign and was going to mail the signature card to the Missouri address. I told her his signature will not match since he had a stroke. It is August 2022 and that signature card still has not arrived. I have tried calling the branch to no avail. As for the notary services, when I left the bank, I noticed that Camilla only notarized one document even though I gave her two. I immediately returned and told her that she did not notarize the other one. She proceeded to tell me that she could not notarize it because it did not have the specific wording that Texas requires whereas the other document did. I indicated that she did not inform me of that and I asked what does the bank do in a case like that. Then she tells me that the bank has a form that they use. I asked her how is a customer supposed to know this? Tell me where the service was in customer service? Doesn't deserve one star.Everyone is nice and Branch Manager did everything she could to help us. Much Appreciated!

Small critique is the branch never picks up phone and we always have to go in person for small branch inquiries.Went in to make a withdrawal to purchase a trailer. They told me federal law requires that i answer private questions about my private life before they can give me the money.  Told them they already took the money out of my account. How were they able to take the money out but not able to hand it to me, that makes no sense.

I asked them of the bank was on federal lands, they said no. I then asked then why must i comply with federal laws? They said because they are a bank. Banks are not governments they are businesses and no one is required to do business with a bank.

I asked which federal law requires me to answer your questions. They said the Banking Secrecy Act.... i said not all acts are properly passed into law did the act come with a positive law citation?

They didn't know.

I asked what Title is the Act under?

They didn't know.

They asked me to answer their questions i said the answer is ""private."" I am a private civilian. My account is private not commercial.

They said it does not matter. They could not give me the money they took from my account until i answered questions about my private life. That they didn't know what title the act was under or if the act or title was actually a law or a contract.

Finally i answered their question and said im a researcher. That wasn't good enough. They said what company, i said no company thats just what i do. They said we cant put that. I said okay, homemaker. That wasn't good enough either. They said what did you do before that? I just laughed..... i said regulatory enforcement specialist with the DOD, which is why i know the bank secrecy act isn't a law and neither is title 12 which makes them offers to contract which requires my agreement.

They handed me my money.Sarah, Gabby & Justin are incredibly nice! They are always so happy to help and find solutions for any problems! There is another lady, I am unsure of her name who occasionally helps me and is super helpful as well! As for the blonde lady that I believe is the branch manager, you have better luck getting help from the LAO’s and Tellers. She has been disrespectful a number of times, when I asked her for her help she said they didn’t do that and I went to one of the other tellers who happily did it for me, & she once made a rude comment about us being out of state. Other than that this is very pleasant branch to visit and the tellers and bankers work so hard because they genuinely care!! Thanks West Lake team!!The branch manager and a few of the tellers have the most unhelpful, passive aggressive, nasty attitude I have seen in any bank. Go to another branch, especially if you are not white. Just saying.The ATM is always broken at this location. Even after it was replaced it’s just on and says it can’t dispense or deposit money.This location is the worst, the drive up ATM always had problems or was always out of service. It got stolen over a month ago and they still haven’t replaced it. So now many ppl are using the one in the lobby and that one has lots of problems too!!! Very inconvenient. Get it together chasePhone rings constantly and no one answers. I had to call the main corporate number to speak to anyone and this branch does not even answer 3 way calls from Corporate. The manager here is rude and does not have experience in customer service. She says they have no voicemail and don’t answer phones if they are with customers in person. Hire someone to answer calls, get a voicemail set up, take responsibility for your poor customer service. Will never bank here due to the poor management and their staff unwilling to adapt or adjust to challenging timesTerrible customer service, wouldn’t open acct b/c they closed in 30 mins. It was the delivery of the message that could have been better delivered. If acct takes 2 min to open online why does it take 45 min in person???? Makes no sense… manager had a non-caring way of delivering the message. Never coming back here… eATM is so unreliable, update your machine! I usually go in the lobby but today the after hours key is broken. I hate this location! No knock on the staff, they are friendly.Hardly ever any bank tellers. Atm is often brokenThese employees are the best at this tomball location.  They truly comforted me in a time of need concerning concerning my business account with Chase Chase they made me feel as if my needs were there number oneAs of May 2023 there’s a new atm that’s fully functional.Long waitingOctober 21, 23. There are 2 tellers and 1 customer service accounts manager. When I walked in there was 7 people waiting for the accounts manager and a line almost to the door for the tellers. I have now been waiting for over a hour, because I am unable to get into my app and was unable to receive assistance over the phone. This experience is making me want to close my account! Chase you need to do better!","Positives:

523,Chase Bank,"16802 El Camino Real, Houston, TX 77058",Houston,"I’ve come to this bank on multiple occasions this weekend attempting to free my account from being restricted. A check written, withdrawn from the check issuers account and deposited into my account. Great right? However Chase decided to not put a hold on the check, but on my entire account.
A full week without being able to access any of my funds. 5 facility visits, 4 calls with the issuers assistance, and many on the banks end. They continued to ask if the check was legitimate. Saying they needed to confirm the issuer “really actually wrote it” and I wasn’t committing  fraud. (keep in mind the funds were already in the frozen account, check issuer called the 1-877 number and confirmed there was no hold, and minutes before entering the facility I had spoken to a rep who confirmed the check cleared) They continued to push the narrative that it was a fraudulent check and I was almost being accused. This is the second time this happens with chase and I suggest you go elsewhere if you would like to avoid similar situations. It’s been a headache and at this point I will be switching banks.So I'm currently sitting in a Chase Bank in Bellaire. One gentleman with a is flirting with a female employee. Both not getting any work done, or ask if they can help me. It's Friday.  Did I forget to say that. UnrealMy banking needs are simple, so I haven't ever needed more than a teller. That said, the employees at this location are always SOOO nice, so accommodating, and do what I need them to do in a sweet and polite manner. Plus they try to actually staff well so I never have to wait long.I am reading through the reviews while waiting in.
One of the bank rep managed to let someone came after me to go see a banker first. I have been waiting in front of him for over 15mins and now that customer is in there for almost an hour. And why I am sitting here waiting still bc I am Asian?Athina is AMAZING!! Wanted to get new notes and Chinese New Year red envelopes and Athina went above and beyond to help. I was told by the bigger Chase on Bellaire that “Fed is not giving out any new notes this year” in Mandarin with a lot of arrogance. (As of Feb 2022) Not sure why I got the treatment. But so grateful I met Athina here and received the best service!Good customer service 👍 …They close my business account and I have money in there  I been waiting 2 month I didn't get my money back try to call no body answer the phone try to make appointment online can't for walk in no assistant available. So when open the account they need money on time but when we need money back I have to wait for long time and no one can't help me too.There's always an issue with the ATMS at this location.. ALWAYS .I have been contacted this chase bank. I was hung up several times.  Thinking to open new account. Now changing my mind to go with another bankService is soooo slow at this branch. And they don’t really seem to care. It’s bad inside as well as at the window.Drive thu is terrible
You know you have many people coming and one of them is closedWorst customer service ever, and I used to work at Chase. Unreal.If anything may go wrong in Chase it will. Proven several times.They don’t answer phone callsLong ah waitSlow and unprofessionalTerribleworst service not recommended","Positives:

524,Chase Bank,"1200 Clear Lake City Blvd, Houston, TX 77062",Houston,"I highly recommend just going to the Chase branch in Summerwood or on Will Clayton parkway unless you have 30+ minutes to wait. There is no operational ATM. There is only one drive up lane. It is literally always busy. The lane to get into the drive up window traps you in so you can't even get out of line. They really should just fix this place up or close it down.

Outside of that, the workers are friendly and helpful and likely deserve a raise since they have to deal with people who are probably upset about the aforementioned issuesDisappointed! I work 10 hour shifts most days and would be nice to make a single trip to the atm to make a simple deposit then be on my way home to my kids but unfortunately today was my THIRD trip this week. Please FIX it! Super inconvenient.This branch is a waste of time and space for this to be the fall creek location its so run down only one atm that never works you cant deposit or withdrawal money from it ever so its basically like not even having a bank near there is no walk up atm like other branches so there is no alternative to get money its so disappointing because I have to drive out of my way just to use and atm chase please remodel retrain and restaff this location ‼️Worse service I’ve ever received. You have to wait in line for about 20-30 minutes and when you finally get to the teller, they either have an issue like their pin pad doesn’t work or their system is down. Also very rude.Horrible,Be careful when withdrawing money from this ATMs they are Hack either by someone that works there or someone else...They will steal your money from your account and Chase will not Refund your money or even investigate who it was,Chase will blame you.I had a terrible incident in this branch by the way I live in Cleveland tx.I withdrawal $40 dollars on my way to work since I take beltway 8 and on the next day it show that I did a transaction of $40 than a $500 dollar one What?Chase said that they couldn't investigate or even check the dam cameras.This guys are thieves!!! Be careful!!! And I know how hard it is to earn your money..Had a great experience today at your branch, just wanted to make a shout out to the chase team on their excellent customer service, especially Miss Julita, thank you so much!Terrible customer service!! I didn't get the lady's name, but she's a heavy set white lady sitting at the teller counter. She was so rude to me. She embarrassed me by the way she treated me. Then when I went to deposit my husband's check and she saw his name suddenly she started treating me better and immediately apologized.Opened a chase account because this location is close to home but it is not nearly as convenient as I’d anticipated. I’m actually planning to change banks as a result.The line for the teller was long and there also seem to be a few ppl waiting to see an advisor.  Luckily I just had to deposit a chk that I could use one of the two automated machines.  In and out in 4min.I am an account holder for ten years. The bank would not provide a Medallion Signature service saying they only provide this service if you have an Estate Account with Chase

I'm another occasion I asked for notory services and the branch refused saying they would not notorized anything that required a witness.

There are way better online banks, if a brink and mortar bank can not provide  routine service of a brink and mortar then find another bank.They have horrible customer & very bad technology! They atms did not print out my money and they did nothing to help me receive my money… I had to talk to the claims person myself for help. Mean while there bank manger is making smart remarks that did not help me… I’m out of state and it was a horrible experience. They don’t provide premium banking.. Humble texaATM NEVER work. Bank is almost always closed.Terrible service. Didn’t want to help me open an account. Trash.Done everything I neededGood bankIt's because I just wanted to open a bank account, they put me on hold for 1 hour and the people in charge of assisting you are not doing anything, there is no sign-up sheet, they just make you sit down and keep you there until they feel like calling you.I asked them for someone to help me refinance my house, they told me that the person who does it at that moment was not there but to leave my information and he would call me. It's been more than 1 week and nothing
And it's been months and still with NOTHING!!!","Positives:

526,Chase Bank,"5104 Bellaire Blvd, Bellaire, TX 77401",Houston,"Always short staffed and never available. Was there on Monday to open a business account. They said they don’t have a banker to open the account and asked me to schedule an appointment for Friday. I said I can’t wait that long and told them I’ll go to another branch. I also wanted to cash a check. So stood in line for 25 min. Only one teller was working. 3 others were outside just talking and chilling while there were almost 10 ppl in line waiting. The lady behind me lost it and started yelling, then one of the 3 tellers decided to come back to work. I’m surprised how bad the customer service is and it’s a brand new location… went to Wells Fargo and they opened the business account the same day.This branches customer service is absolutely horrible. I'm extremely disappointed and will definitely be taking my business elsewhere. The banker who assisted me with opening my account will not return my phone calls nor will he respond to my emails. I have several questions that only he can answer. Again the customer service is absolutely horrible. Very unprofessional all the way around, even the tellers..talking laughing and gossiping while I waited.You would think they could at least make something easy on you. After a number of leaddowns I decided to close my account.  I was told that I can't and I have to make an appointment for later on in the day. This is ridiculous and just further affirmation that I will never do business with Chase Bank againHello Goodmorning! So today around 9:25-9:28! I decided to come into the bank for cash advance! I spoke to everybody as I came in even the guy behind me! As he stated I look like Whoopi Goldberg and turnt to the LADY that work there and started laughing! I found that very offensive and unprofessional for the lady to do so! I didn’t get her name but she’s an older African American lady! Thank youHorrible service the employees here don’t want to do there job, rather talk to each other. I needed help and they just said whatever you need you can just can call the number on your card. I highly recommend you avoid this brand and get rid of these employees.I had to go twice and I couldn't open a checking account, every time I went they told me I needed a different document, my documents issued by the United States government and my social security only made me waste my time. all this for being from another countryI arrived at 5 minutes to 4 and they didn't want to attend to me, and that was to open an account.Did not open an account on Saturday, although they worked!","Positives:

527,Chase Bank,"9400 N Sam Houston Pkwy E, Humble, TX 77396",Houston,"The staff here are very professional and polite. Especially the associate at the first/reception desk. Eli the banker who assisted with my transaction was very professional and helpful and efficient. I was nervous based on some of the other reviews. I will say they really encourage you to use your tools in the app and online first, but I am okay with that. It is why I was here (i had gotten locked out of the app and didn’t have my acct number anywhere else). Overall my experience was great.Visited the branch for my new account, waited 15 mins but 2 bankers “yvette james” and other lady were busy chatting. Just left the branch after the wait and no response from banker or tellerWorst banking experience I’ve had. Opened an account and became a signer on my mothers. Told them and showed them I had an identity theft case. They said no issue. Fast forward a week and mine as well as my mothers account have been closed. She was a customer there over 16 years. They closed both due to accusing me of being a fraud even after I showed them the police report. They didn’t even bother to contact either of us about the decision via email, letter, or phone. They went against federal regulations in their process of closing the accounts. I will NOT recommend anyone to use them.This is the best branch I ever experienced.  People work there are always very polite and very helpful. I love to go there before pandemic.  Things are certainly changed nowadays but they remain professional and courteous. I went to the branch the other day to get some cash and inquired some new bills.  Sunnysuraj helped me get exact what I wanted patiently.  I am very thankful to him and the branch.This is the first Chase branch I’ve been that does not have ATM INSIDE. Only drive thru and that one is not working properly. Just to withdraw money has to wait in line. And when I was there there were 3 tellers but two of them were serving one customer so 1 teller has to serve the rest. And it was 7 or 8 customers there. When you are in a rush it is very upsetting.I was in a hurry and needed some details changed on my account, and Mitchell Huynh went out of his way to squeeze me in in-between appointments. Most would not have done that, so Kudos to you man! Need more people in customer service like him.Door says 6 online says 5, pick one.Always friendly and polite
The service is more than satisfyingATM is never working properly. Will be switching to a new bank that provides a working atm.Can I speak to a representative at this location?  Apparently not.","Positives:

Nice to visit this bank anytimeThis location is fairly new it's only been open a couple of weeks but if you can avoid this location I would do so. Everytime I've came in it seems to be understaffed big time! There is always only one teller at the window so always a long line that moves very slowly. Also there is no a/c at this location even though it is new. Long wait plus no a/c. I would have preferred the old location staying open.Awesome staff. No wait time.

530,Chase Bank,"15380 N Eldridge Pkwy, Cypress, TX 77429",Houston,"The tellers have disappointing customer service skills and are even more incompetent than those at other locations. I understand why Bank of America is gradually phasing them out and embracing full automation across the city.Did not honor my appointment time.  Learn from my mistake and don't bother wasting time at this location, go to another branch or better yet another bank.  I came in today around 1pm and was told I needed to make an appointment (no customers were in the offices, so I assume all the representatives were finishing lunch and couldn't be bothered).  They set an appointment for 3pm, and I went home. Came back at 3pm, and the representative was running behind with another customer.  I asked if anyone else could see me, and the only other person was ""in a meeting.""  I waited for 20 minutes, and during that time the person ""in a meeting"" sat looking at his computer, picked up the phone at one point, talked for awhile, put it down, and sat some more.  With no sign of the prior customer being done any time soon, I decided to leave at the 20 minute mark.   They suggested I go to a different branch, and I drove 10 minutes to the next nearest one.  They told me the only ones who could help me were at the branch on Washington!  Not sure why they take appointments if they won't honor them, but I am very frustrated about wasting my time today for something that should have taken five minutes.The customer service here has gone way down hill. The lines are so long. These big banks are able to obtain customers by their size and scale. But they take their customers for granted. Its hard to compete against the ubiquity of BofA's atm network. So they feel like they can just do whatever they want and jerk customers around. As a person of color, I wait for like 15 minutes for the teller. She started doing some task the moment she saw me. The line got longer behind me as I waited. Then when it finally came my turn to only other teller on duty. She finally took her next customer, a white man. These tellers are just completely racist!Update - Funny how they reach out on google reviews right away. They had their chance in the branch. This is not a normal bank. Their policies are terrible. Not the normal customer service you'd receive anywhere else!

This is by far the worst bank I've ever used. I'm making the switch out of this place! Every little thing that is simple for a regular bank is a huge issue! This is by far the worst experience for my business partners and myself.Terrible customer service.  DO NOT BANK with BoA!!!  -

edit - thanks for the automated response to the bad review.  I am not interested in actively following up with your organization.  Rather, I would prefer you adjust your policies and train your people to take care of customers the first time, when they’re there in the lobby.

I do not have, nor will I ever have, an Account with BoA because of the lack of customer friendly policies and the lack of welcoming, accommodating staff.  A resounding “no” was all I was told today.

You are in a SERVICE industry.  It is literally your JOB to meet and exceed the needs of current and potential customers.  None of what I experienced today (and previous interactions with BoA) leads me to believe customer relations matter to your organization.DO NOT TRUST BOA WITH YOUR MONEY.

This institution is incompetent, has suspect ethics, and terrible customer service. When you try to handle issues politely and send letters with all the proof requested they will turn around and gaslight you saying you didn't supply the proof requested. You will patiently try again and confirm again they received all the required the documents and then they will send you a letter back saying they don't have enough proof and name exactly the proof you supplied as what is missing.I've had the opposite experience here. Everyone has always been extremely friendly, professional, and quick.

This is a very busy location, so they're generally a wait.Absolutely awful. Every time I’ve been here they only have 1 teller working and enough spots for 8. Never staffed. Rude  branch manager when speaking to him. Never would recommend.Wonderful service of the staff

Quick

Friendly

Helpful in every way possible

Thanks to the Manager

Then when you try to pay your fee, THEY DON’T ACCEPT ANYTHING BUT DEBIT CARDS. That’s absurd!!!!!Bank of America is terrible. They have locations that are just ATM centers. The Bank Downtown has no parking, no information on the parking and no one is available. How do they have any business at this location? I am so glad I canceled my account at this bank. Just a waste of time looking for locations.This location has undergone a remodel, not sure how long ago that was completed but the remodel includes having only one teller working. If you are lucky enough to show up around lunch time then there are no tellers working. No tellers at a bank!!! The 3 other people in the location, I can only assume are sales associates were very happy to let me know there is no teller available to help out.

532,Chase Bank,"2929 Shaver St, Pasadena, TX 77502",Houston,"There is absolutely Nothing pleasant about this location. As the matter of fact it is the worst location I have been to in houston. Needed to stop by the bank urgently in the area. Teller literally wen to the back room after I and 3 more customers walked it. We had to wait for the one teller to finish helping the other customer for over 15min. While front desk is just talking amongst themselves and laughing. No trash cans. Inside looks recently renovated but it is NOT ran well! Definitely do NOT feel like your business is appreciated upon visiting this branch! Needless to say I will never stop by this branch even if it's close by.This 1 star is for the ridiculously greedy policy of CASH Deposit Fee. Yes they charge a fee for depositing too much CASH into their bank within a given statement cycle. I have never heard of such a thing. People read your bank agreements when you open accounts and check your statements. They pay NO INTEREST but charges fees for depositing money into their bank which they use to make money!If you call, expect to be on hold for a minimum of 20 minutes before you reach a person. On top of that, once I waited 20 minutes the first time, I was hung up on after the representative told me that they cannot verify a cashier's check, and asked additional questions because this is part of my job and I verify checks with other BOA Branches almost daily. I called the 1-800 number for BOA, and they said the branch can complete this for us. I tried to call again and waited an additional 20 minutes, and was unsuccessful in reaching anyone. Due to their lack of service, their client who has chosen them as a bank won't be able to receive keys on their new home today.I had a very pleasant experience with my visit here. Lisa and Fidelia were so nice and sweet helping me with all of my questions. There was another person that was very polite that greeted me and assisted me, but I was not able to catch her name.Only Bank that I know where they Open at 10 am and close at 4 pm everyday. This COVID excuse to be Lazy than ever other Bank Branch is Ridiculous. Making people wait outside till they open usually 15-20 people. Someone is going get Robbed outside No security. WOWWWW!!!!!!It is very narrow driveway just make for a smart carService with Mrs.Stephnie was excellent but was there yesterday and had to return today because hand held machine to extract money from government card not working and always an ongoing problem at the bank on south victory and shepherd branch there needs to be more than one of these machines in branches so this want be happeningIt’s Friday at 2:45 pm and this location is closed. Btw this is the 2nd Bank of America I’ve had to visit due to only have one teller available with a looooong line. We will be moving our business account. Ridiculous!The 2 machines in one lane is a hassle and many customers do not know how to courteously navigate this lane.This bank is to big to have one slow worker behind the counter it's hot in here with long lines.Friendly atmosphere Respect and value of TimeDon't bother going here, they have no desire to help you.Good serviceNO ONE ANSWERS PHONEThis has to be the worst bank in all of HoustonConvenient, n quick...My FavoriteBest serviceTrashy bankI do not recommend Bank of America, bad experience","Positives:

I was lead to believe I had an appointment and drove all the way to the branch and turns out there was no appointment. I wasted all my time and gas to drive there and they didn't even care to at least call me to cancel the appointment. Very bad business here. I was so upset put still stuck with them, two weeks later I couldn't any more. The business department here is a joke. I just had to go to another branch.Worst bank ever! They stole my money in the past! They yell at the elderly people! Had to get a cashiers check to the IRS , they misspelled Internal! Had to pay an extra $15 so they can fix their mistake! Now I’m having to go a third time! Because they didn’t put the correct amount, when it was clearly on the last check! Now I’m sure I’m going to pay again for the third check to get fixed! That’s $45 for one check that their staff can’t get it together! Ridiculous! Definitely changing bank! I suggest you do too!worse location ever, got here since they open and even if i didn’t have an appointment worse customer service, get better Bank of America.My bank from now on. Ms. Dazuree and her staff are freaking awesome. Wish I would have banked with them sooner. Ms.Dazuree great job and keep your staff greatAlways busy and lines move slow. They have about 4 outside atms, they also have one inside that is usually open when the inside of the bank is open.Came here to open a New Account and I can yell you this location is completely under staffed with horrendous wait times. The looks on people's faces when I asked how long the wait was spoke volumes. Sourt of like being in a crowded Dr's office waiting to be seen. Not very welcoming at all. Hopefully they work on this but with a 2 star rating,  I doubt it.This bank never has enough people working!
Line is always ridiculous!
I’ve been in line for almost an hour. Only 1 teller inside the bank!
Then one of the employees comes to the front and lets the business owner and us personal account owners know the lines are joined together. Both of the people in the  business owners line knew they were here way after a lot of us in line and still stated they were here before hand. I spoke up but got ignored and they still got seen before any of us!

One of them had a bag of coins that needed to be counted!!

This situation just irritated me! 1 for the people being horrible dishonest people & 2 when I spoke up I got ignored.

Now I’m still here waiting in line!Stood in the business client line for 15 min. No one acknowledged me or nothing . Guess they don’t like money hereThis location have 5 ATM machines and not one was working to dispense cash.  And this is not the first time.One teller working
40 minutes wait at the line full of people
Babies crying. People are losing patience. But no one cares
6 other employees standing around doing nothing joking gigglingTerrible Bank of America ever. This place never has enough staff to serve the customers that come in. Literally every time I’m there there’s a line wrapped around the building and ppl wait to out for a long time. Commercial is a little faster but still could use some more employees or something to make the flow goes smoothly. They have a tendency to use the one teller to go back and forth from helping ppl in line and in the drive through which in return we end up waiting even longer. Ugh just terrible as i mentioned all the way!! The drive through would the worst mistake you make when going to that location. I’ve only tried a few time but all of them I waited more than 30 min to be attended. This place just needs more staff and the drive through more expedited.In over 15 years banking with BoA and I had yet to be disappointed with them. Walked in today 11/07/2022 with a high amt check made out to me with my maiden name. My acct now reflects my married last name. My debit card has my maiden name. And I provided them with my passport with my maiden name. But they would not deposit my check Incase it bounced. Now do note this was the 3rd check I had deposited (or was planning to deposit - the other 2 checks cleared) into my account with my maiden name. Even though lady swore the acct needed to match the check that would be deposited. Since when does a bank not accept to deposit $ into your own account... it's not like I wanted to cash this check 🤬🤬🤬Lanes are pretty narrow so watch your mirrors.Really bad customer service, lady’s are having conversations in the back while the line is very long.  I waited in line for more than one hour already, I am very upset!!!!Worst place to bank at... Waited over an hour in the business account line for them to tell me I couldn't make my deposit while already making a lot of the same deposits before. Customer service is horrible and for the people at the window to ring their little supervisor for everything they don't know. Why have only 3 windows open with un experienced employees.... Horrible experience...Desperate need of staff. Every single time i come its a 30min wait for ANYTHING. They have 6 teller slots and only 2 are used everyy single day. Save your time and go to another Bank of America not this one. Awesome bank, terrible locationmanager has a horrible attitude when asking questions maybe that’s why there’s no tellers to help here due to her attitude with customers every time I come into this location there’s always just one teller.The person who attended me was excellent but she forgot to tell me that bank of America can close my account whenever they want without any notifications , I had my money there and they close my account without letting me know the worst experience ever I won't come back to this bank or recommend to anyoneCareless costumer service cold and rainy and they left people outside Making a line.there are a lot of people all the time and they never do anything to satisfy the customer, very lousy service.Aggravating service, plus I was given counterfeit money when I cashed my check....then once I addressed the problem,  well I was not refunded...Worst experience. Waited 50 min with one person indront of me to ge told to wait a minute when my turn.Easy drive thru quick serviceI will give them zero stars ⭐️ if possible, long lines, McDonald’s have better costumer service.Location inIt's always a problem at this location in the customer service is horribleThis place is a time killing place no customer services LOOOOOONG LINE. LIMITED TELLER NO RESPECT TO CUSTOMER.The Worst tellers they slow they don’t care the people.Pathetic service. Staff is not helpful . Hour long que. Even online deposit are not available.  Its not a bank at allNeed more tellers, be prepared to wait atleast 30 mins.1 hour 10 mins for deposit a cheque. PATHETIC !Easy Service😃🤑 …Good family customer serviceThe worst bank in houston !!!!!!!!
Hands downGreat service..Bank of America is trashOkayWhenever I come they take too long no matter the process they always take foreverThey treat you as if you were a scammer I just wanted to pay a check from a company I work for they treated me as if I was asking for free moneyTerrible very bad serviceTerrible service you have an appointment and you spend 2 hours waiting","Positives:

534,Bank of America,"909 Fannin St STE G100, Houston, TX 77010",Houston,"Because this is a busy branch, do not expect reasonable wait times.  Every time I come  here I am forced to wait 30+ minutes for anything. From a simple and common request to a complex transaction.  It’s always “10 more minutes” for an eternity.I usually just use the ATM but where it's located Is really convenient for meIt was a bad service. When I arrived at 3:30, no one served at the front desk but employees gathered behind the withdrawal/deposit room for talking. I wanted to do wire transfer but one of employees still made appointment for next day.Emily is the best. She gave me a good advise about banking products.Fast and plenty of space considering it is located at the corner of a very busy shopping strip.Why have a drive thru if it's always closed!!??? Annoying!!They reduced hours. Terrible. Becoming a virtual bank. Need to start moving my checking account","Positives:

535,Bank of America,"5200 N Shepherd Dr, Houston, TX 77091",Houston,"I went there yesterday around 3:00 pm with many doubts and questions and Selena Requena  assisted me with great attitude and professionalism. She was very attentive and with a lot of knowledge she answered my questions I had . I had a very good experience with her. I have been to other banks before but this location makes me feel confident in this bank. I recommend 💯 this location. Go and ask for Selena RequenaWe arrived at 4:00 to find one teller and several people in line.  Our transaction took quite a while and meanwhile the line kept growing.  I felt bad that others had to wait.  I asked if there was another teller but the answer was ""no.""  Apparently this branch is open later than others in the area so many customers come in between 4:00 and 5:00.  Knowing this, the bank should arrange for an additional teller during their last open hour.   Had we known beforehand that 4:00 was the worst time to arrive, we would have come in earlier. The bank personnel were pleasant though.I just don’t know why people don’t have patience and can’t wait , my service was very smooth , fast and easy . If you feel like for whatever reason you need help asap just clear your schedule for the day and be there . FIRST COME FIRST SERVE that’s how every bank isSuper slow customer service. Slowest bank ever!!!I've been to bank of America on Birky st. several times and the service has been outstanding especially Ms. Selena's care for all the important details all around my accounts and products.Terrible customer service! I waited in line for nearly 45 minutes to make one transaction. There was a line of 6+ people and only one teller working. The other employees were standing around, doing nothing.I’ve been there couple of times with my dad for his account, and we dealt with different staff, some were good while some were not. But Ms. Selena Requena was a great help and so friendly when we came last time. She took us in in between appointments and was very attentive to our inquiries and requests. Appreciated her help and assistance.I booked an appointment online, the morning of the appointment someone called me from the bank— on my cell it did not say bank is america so I didn’t answer. When I went  to the bank I found out they cancelled my appointment. They are not helpful, they direct you to do everything online. They don’t want to help you in person. If you want a bank that doesn’t value customer service this location is for you.This location has the worse customer service.  The front receptionist is very rude as well as the tellers(Raquel and Sherrie)  I waited almost an hour just to do a simple transaction.  One teller 6 people in line.  This location in Kirby needs a overhaul staff.  Very, very unprofessional and not friendly staff especially the receptionist person in the front (Carmen) . Very rude people......
9/15/2022
P.S. I am not a current customer with your Institution but my boss is. He sent me to do a transaction for him , but it was the worse experience in your   institution.  I was a banker myself for over 10
years and I treated all my  customers with respect regardless of the situation was.  Not a happy camper non customer of yours and not a happy camper for my boss.  Hope you take this concern seriously................We have been banking at Bank of America since the predecessor banks back in 1973 . We visited the lobby on Kirby Drive this week to do a wire transfer for a new car purchase . We had an amazing experience with Carmina Martinez who greeted us very pleasantly upon entering . It was very obvious to us thank she a great skillset in customer service and made us very aware of the services that Bank of America provided . It’s always wonderful to know when an employee appreciates their job and has a true passion for it. Thanks for having her as part of your work culture and making a great “ first impression “ for Bank of America .The manager working at 1:45pm on Saturday 9/2/23 is not very good at their job.I went there with my mom, we were looking for Spanish speaker rep, and Jose took care of us. He was professional, extremely nice, and fast. It was a great experience.Slowest bank ever!!! No one steps up to help even if there is a long time. Get it together!!!!Many thanks for the help Patricia Martinez. She is an expert who has helped me in various situations. Thank you, Patricia.Racist as ever. You can come with cash needing a cashier check with an account that’s been open for more than 20 yrs and they’ll still manage to laugh in your face and instigate to refuse service. & it’s the manager at that. Poor employee was to scared to stand beside me when I asked for assistance to make sure the transaction went smoothly.Excellent service by Carmina who was receiving people at the front desk, she solved everything in a timely manner. Would come back for sure for my banking needs.I came in person for my personal and business account to request some services. I asked for copies of incoming checks for the year for tax purposes. They also told me to deposit my check using the ATM since there was a long line. I turned the corner to get a deposit slip with no line. On the way out, I requested to be a personal banker instead of a business because I had to make an appointment. The teller, lacking any customer service and professional etiquette, stated he could do it for me but would charge 5$ per check copy, or I can do it myself online for free. Would I be here if I knew and had the time to do that? I walked out in disbelief; the guy was lazy and had no intentions of helping anyone coming through that door.Bank of America is the worst bank to bank with. This bank in particular has the worst customer service, I was told to wait while the tellers were finishing their conversation. While there was no one in the bank to begin with I had to wait to until the had completed their personal conversation. The ATM is a different story while trying to pull money out of my account it replied there is a certain limit per “transaction”. I then put the maximum amount for that certain transaction then it replied I’ve exceeded my transaction limit! I haven’t pulled anything out today! This bank is the most ridiculous bank with poor customer service.Everyone is very friendly, I come to this branch from Katy, Tx, but here they make me feel welcome, the branch manager carmina and stuff always smiling.I thank the staff and Vitor Burk specially for helping me out to open an account. He is extremely diligent, well articulated and makes sure the customer experience is hassle free. I had a great experience here. Thank you Vitor.I went There for open an account.I got an appointment with Kryslyn.she was awesome she help me for all of my queries. And she was very friendly had a wonderful experience with Kryslyn.thank you again kryslyn...🥰 …Great service from Ms. Requena. She is very nice and patient to help me for banking services. Also very professional. Resolved my problem. I really appreciate her help!If I could give a negative star I would . I wasted so much time in line . When I tried to withdraw cash I showed my passport and they alleged it wasn’t enough. It’s a passport it’s a valid Id. Don’t bother stopping here if you need to withdraw large amounts of cash . Manager didn’t even try to help .Wasted an hour of my time making changes to my account so I could deposit a check. Turns out changes weren’t made and the check hasn’t gone through. Business advisor has no idea what she’s doing.I am newly arrived international student so, today i went here to open my new bank account services here is too good and fast staff is very friendly. My documentation was done  by adrian gonzalez he guide me about everything very friendly and professional person. Best bank 😃😃 …Selena Requena is very professional and very courteous. She is attentive to our needs. We enjoy coming to this branch for her services. She is amazing ands very sweet.Ive been using
This bank for years and their service got really better. ImpressiveExcellent service and experience.
Vitor Burk was so helpful and kind. Also speaks Portuguese and Spanish, which is a great plus.A young banker, Kevin Vasquez, helped us with what I thought was a complicated change of trustee for a trust,  Kevin rocked through the process.  If this is being recorded, Kevin, you are underpaid!!  Thank you for your help today.Terrible staff and experience. 20+ year customer, and they waste your time and try to get you to come back to “sell” you products you don’t want. I’m moving my accounts.Great place to have advice, make your credit cards, and do other financial related topics to discussWorst customer service. No respect to people time at all.Safe location. No heavy traffic, neighborhood police aroundService here is awful. Unfriendly, unprofessional staff and management.You guys are the best, thank you for take care of me. Always with a smile.Customer service is non-existent. Go to the location on Richmond.Lol yeah just go to the next nearest location. Kirby is a jokeExtremely rude and unprofessional.markMy husband and I were attended by the manager Vitor Burk, I was extremely satisfied with the service, especially for being a Brazilian who facilitated my communication, being in Portuguese!
so far we are resolving some issues on my account but at no time has he set aside or forgotten the problem, on the contrary! every week calls to find a different way to solve the same!

536,Bank of America,"10612 Eastex Fwy, Houston, TX 77093",Houston,"Hated today , this made me realize what type of bank in with and pulling out my money today and going somewhere else , I had a appointment with LORI WILSON , y’all have to teach that lady how to talk to someone , talk to you like you are clueless and makes you feel little .Osmin was great.   Made an appointment, was ready on time.   Opened two biz bank accounts.   Very fast.   Professional.   Knowledgeable.  Manager always very nice to greet in the front.  Overall one of the best branches I’ve been to.Honestly hate that I have to come here. Everytime I come here they only have two tellers. Even when they know they have a bunch of people in line to simply cash checks. I'm lucky when they have two tellers. That's why Im not ever seeing up an account here. It takes way too long. I would think they'd care more about theirs customers time.I visited this branch on Wednesday afternoon. They cleared the line in front of the tellers rapidly. Great customer service.The absolute worst Bank of America. Whyyy is the line always out the door and they have one maybe two tellers. I’ve been here dozens of times to deposit for my company and have never been in and out in under 30 minutes. Why can’t them seem to adequately staff the bank? I hate it as a customer but as the lone teller working there I would literally KMS.Ms. Edna Moore is it for customer service! She set me up with one on one digital education. I was in severe distress after losing my cards & let me tell you, she brought me peace & digital education. She did this patiently, calmly and graceful, WHILE helping other customers! Thank you Ms. Edna, you so right for us!Osmin Chavarria was amazing! He helped me fill out paperwork and was very friendly. Very professional and willing to help.I absolutely abhor using this bank. They are impossible to get on the phone and they are extremely unhelpful. I will be pulling my money out today.it is the total disappointment, their machine swallowed me $ 620 that I can not find anywhere in my balance, I called since December 06 until today I have no follow-up. that is armaterism in the reception of complaints in the agency.Only pleasant emotions after visiting the bank.  The staff is very wonderful.I have been  treated respectfully every time I've had to get help from cashing a check to opening accounts and credit
Mrs.Moore is the best!!!  Thank youI was going to switch from Chase Business after 5 years  but BOA wouldn’t let me open an my account unless I changed it to an LlcYess across the board Ms. Edna Moore made sure I was well taken care of everyone was kind and knowledgeable I will continue to bank here thank you team😊 …They always have system errors.

537,Bank of America,"3904 Richmond Ave., Houston, TX 77027",Houston,"Great service, fast, and with a reasonable wait time. A couple of the ATMs were down for maintenance during my visit but I don't anticipate that will take too long. Conveniently located too, so that's a bonus for clients in the area.Went to deposit a check in-person and the teller/banker first deposited the wrong amount. Was about to leave when I saw the receipt with the incorrect amount. Went back and he changed the amount, however, when I checked my account later that day I found that he cashed the same check twice (which is technically check fraud and illegal). Thankfully I called BoA and their customer service member fixed the issue and also documented my report…but this is basic banking 101. Extremely disappointed with their service!11/08/21: This location is the worst, understaffed. How can they have only one person in the front assisting everyone and a customer has to wait for more than 20 minutes to get assisted is ridiculousCannot even get anyone on the phone to let me know they have a notary available.  No customer service besides a computer that cannot answer my question and then hangs up on me.Line always long, don't come here if you have stuff to take care of.

539,Bank of America,"2223 Gessner Rd, Houston, TX 77080",Houston,"Customer service needs improvement big time!!
Many things that I can do online in other banks, you have to do it in person here!! Their waiting time to see customers is never less than two hours and while waiting you can see the employees walking around and talking to each other.
The only reason I have to not close all my accounts there is that B of A has been my bank forever but I’m looking forward for the time that I can walk out of this hell.Opened an account at this branch today. The banker, Mr. Map On, who helped me and my wife with the process is exceptionally professional and friendly. He was very knowledgeable, helpful, and patient in explaining the products available. He even notified me that he understood my mother tongue when I talked to my wife, in respect of my privacy. By far my best experience going to a bank.It's an awesome experience,  I walked into the bank and the first thing that caught my attention was the smile from Alassane Gaye as he welcomed me into he's office,  I love his charisma and his customer service,  he took his time to explain to me all about how to build my credit scores. And he did a pretty good job.
And he kept on a smile ☺ throughout our conversations...
He even explained everything about building my credit scores in 🖼 pictures

I will give him a 5 🌟I had the pleasure of working with Map On, and I am extremely pleased with the experience. Throughout the entire process, Map exhibited remarkable communication skills, keeping me informed at every step and promptly addressing any concerns I had. Their approachability and willingness to listen made the experience smooth and stress-free. I highly recommend Map On for anyone seeking exceptional banking services.Alassane Gaye is a very wonderful person.
He was the one that told me about preferred reward program, and l have been loosing money until he sit me down in his office and told me everything that l need to know about my money sitting in my account without making any benefit.
I have been using Bank of America for more than 7 years but l have never met any one like Alassane. Is an amazing person and he knows the job very well.Worst Customer Service Ever. 12 In line to make a simple deposit took 40 minutes to get to the window. Because they only had one customer service rep. I asked the manager why and she said hes that. I should be thankful that they allowed them to have a customer service rep. But yet they've got 6 or 7 rooms. Open up with loan officers, but not 1 person to help at thr counter or that wanted to go help the one guy doing deposits.  40 minutes for a 60 second transaction what a waste &  Bank of America is  the worst.Alassane Gaye is an exceptional bank assistant with unparalleled knowledge of banking procedures and financial products. He is highly skilled, efficient, and attentive he was amaizing, answered all questions that I had and I had a lot of questions , His friendly and welcoming personality provides a warmI came in today to open up personal account and had the opportunity to work with Alassane he was very helpful and nice took time repeating and explaining things to me he also helped me set up my digital wallet and walked outside with me to the ATM to teach me about the stuff I needed help with I am very thankful for that . This man is so polite and helpful no word can express how thankful I am you made my day Mr AlassaneI came in and was in a great hurry, and I asked one bank officer if I could get some statements printed up for the consulate. He was vey friendly and responsive and immediately printed these statements for me. It was absolutely wonderful! His name was Miguel Flores and I cannot thank him enough. He is a true asset to Bank of America, a real gem!!Alassane changed my understanding of finances. After politely greeting me, I was surprised to not only be approached by a teller but one that was actively helping not only customers but his own employees. He then educated me on credit card essentials and their worth, and I applied for one right there, I had no idea it would be an easy process. He also felt very trustworthy, while I only spoke to one other person, he went above and beyond to make my experience unique and change how I feel about banks. I cannot thank him enough, and I'd recommend anyone entering the location to seek him out.Got the best customer care service today 01/26/23 from Mr Alassane Gaye. After years of banking with BOA and no one could convince me of the need to get a Credit card,he was able to educate me clearly and also assisted me in getting one.
He was so calm,cheerful,friendly,hospitable and above all patient in answering all my questions.
I definitely recommend him for any good interaction/solution any customer might need. Such a great leader he added value to my financial life.

He still scanned it which caused me more headaches trying to get it cashed because other check cashing places wouldn't because of the bank's markings.  He w a blonde haired man who was there Saturday🤬🤬🤬🤬I walked into this bank facility yesterday to make a payment on one of my credit cards. I had to wait in line for about an hour; because it was only one teller and people in front of me were doing multiple transactions. Yall need to hire more tellers to avoid long wait times.I've been in business as a small business owner that hit a huge crash during Covid. Only grossing in 30K for the year 2021. I went into this branch today to open a account with 5K cash. I wanted to test the client relations services and see if I'd be discriminated against and if Bank of America really values their clients. I was approached by Emilio Pineda who comes off very friendly but was not knowledgeable about small business protocol. I've been doing business since 2010 but signed under a DBA since 2013. I've taxed all needed documents and kept a report with SBA since 2017. I've been a full time dental specialist but since February of 2022 I've taken on my self owned business full time and no longer decided to work for other companies because if my self owned business is doing 60K a year and after the pandemic 30K passively I should really approach this full on. I showed Certificates of formation for my LLC that I registered in Delaware and was I was told by Mr. Pineda that Bank of America would not accept my Resign letter from Legal Zoom that gives me the rights to open a bank account for my LLC. I pretended to act as though Mr. Pineda was informative but I knew he was just discriminating and not informative of Delaware LLC codes. I'm a African American woman in the urban community with a worldwide business. I was utterly disgusted by the lack of competence of this Bank of America Associate. He gave me a laid back approach with his delivery as well as if he needed to be ""hip or cool"" (so-to-speak) with me but I was just so disgusted by the bigotry. Before coming to Bank of America I sat with my Finacial Advisor Shelton Dalton and we are still appalled by how dismissive Mr. Pineda was. He also assumed I needed a loan. I kept having to ask him what will I need a loan for, he said to start and im am fully equipped and even searching for storefront property as I'm getting ready to expand. I'm a professional so I continued to smile and ""act"" unaware and just allowed him to talk to me about nothing. My twin brother is an accountant and my older sister is a Senior VP for a bank for the whole southern region in the U.S. I'm very aware of business banking I just wanted to transition from being a 9-5 employee  to a full time business owner. I will try again at another branch and hopefully get better client relation services and a more professional representative that is knowledgeable. Thank You.Always coming to this location and Alou is always ready to help. He has a great attitude, such a great leader! I definitely recommend going to him if you need anything. Keep up!I called this branch last week Tuesday 3:29pm asking about opening a back door IRA account, the guy first was dismissing me outright without listening ( I have an accent) then when I insisted have been told BOA have this type of investment option, he insisted to know how much I want to invest before he can get me to talk to a financial specialist, said Frank will call me, it’s one week & no one has called.
Today I call to follow up & Cynthia is treating me the same attitude, “I can’t understand what you are saying” …even before I explain she starts cutting me and loudly explaining mid my sentence, till I told her stop cutting me, let me talk…..& I raised the issue on how they are treating some customers just because I have an accent doesn’t  mean I can’t afford an investment. This branch does not value diversity. Your customer care is wanting. I’ll look into other banks .Mr. Alassane Gaye is a Great host and he helped me to understand that Bank of America has me covered when I ( the customer) needs help the most.The worst customer service I’ve experienced in my whole life!!! They care Zero about their customers, and have no esucation at all. All this being a Preferred Customer!!!

And all I get as a preferred customer is a standard response. Is this the way Bank of America treats their customers? Is this the way you value our business? I’m still waiting for the employee that hang the phone to call me back!I used my lunch break to travel this location to pay my rent. I was told there would be no teller Inside until 230pm. Yes the drive through was open but, I did not have a car. Myself and several customers walked out wondering why is this happening. Maybe under the sign about your new hours there should be a caption that's states but, not inside.4 ladies just hanging about, 3 works in glass just chatting but no one can open a new account.Some please explain as to why every time I go in there there is only ONE teller and drive thru is CLOSED! I see they have 6 bankers and ONE TELLER ... why? If you're in a hurry do not come hereThese people are ssssssslllllllloooooooowwwww! I can't say that enough. A place without a drive thru, you would think that they would have more tellers on the inside. Nope! They let one teller work the whole time with six people in the line waiting. Not impressed and will find another branch 🙄 …I've been with Bank of América since I was student, they are always there to help me with any problem. Today Mr. Thomas Freeman was the one helping me, thank you so much for all explanation about my account. All I can say is thank you for the patience,  I just love Bank of América.If you wake up one day with the urge to be treated like crap… Then come here. Staff is rude, lack basic communication skills and do not care about you or your business. Bank of America is a disgrace.Mr Alassane Gaye has really been going above and beyond in assisting me with my financial goals in order to succeed financially through Bank of America products.They have a separate line for business clients but they keep taking personal account holders that came in after me. So I should’ve just stood in personal accounts line.Frank Martinez is a Racist and the manager is rude never again will I visit this location and all honesty I just want close all my account's and go to a different bank I do not recommend this bank to anyoneBest service ever. Make sure to ask for Mr Alassane Gaye. Good guy always there to helpTake so long.. bad customer service and racist…😩 …Alas sane made banking simple easy very professionalAlassane is just great . Thank you for always taking care of me and my familyMap ON was very helpful and informative.ALASSANE GAYE is so kind, so good speaking well giving us good comfortThis location need to be closed 😩  the  lady in the front today she don't help at all very very lazy …Map ONThank you Map!What's up with the bank not opening on time? And associates not picking up the phone?Short line good customer service.Terrible waiting time with just one teller.Excellent costumer Service and Financial assessmentJust rude for no reason.Broken ATMs, closed office... this place is terrible.Nobody answered the phoneAlou the  bestI made an appointment at Bank of America and I chose to be received by Alassane Gaye according to the reviews I had read and honestly I wasn't into it. He was very professional, smiling, friendly and attentive to my requests and questions. More patient because I made small mistakes and instead of getting angry he helped me without wrinkling his face. The icing on the cake is that he speaks French so I had all my explanations in French. Thank you Alassane 😀
Thank you Bank of America 🙏🏽What a bad customer service. They blocked my card, I call customer service and they tell me that I have to go to a branch to confirm my cell phone number. When I am at the bank after waiting 1 hour they tell me that I have to make an appointment when they only had to confirm my number. So I can't use the card until they give me the appointment. BAD CUSTOMER SERVICEI just came to ask about a car loan and the person in front angelina is too rude and racist they had never asked me for my debit card to ask she has bad customer service is only good when their boss looks at her and people who speak Spanish treat them badly they should better not the image of a bank can be damaged by a person

When I asked if I could talk to a person in the office, she told me that she was the boss lol

I just come to ask about a car loan and the person in front of Angelina is too rude and racist. They have never asked me for my debit card to ask. She has bad customer service.

When I wanted to make a payment with that bill, the same ATM did not accept the bill when I entered the bank and they did not help me because ""there was no ATM available."" The lady was friendly but the first process was terrible. Last time I used this bank agency pension!! How is it possible that the ATM gives you a bill that the ATM itself does not accept? It is acceptable?Bad customer service, unprofessionalism on the part of the bank manager, I always have problems with my account, I do not recommend Bank of AmericaExcellent customer service and great help from Mr. Alassane Gaye.

I visited to make a cash deposit (done this many times) and Abraham was giving me the run around as to why I shouldn't make a cash deposit due to security - and it made me feel very insecure.A representative approach to my car and took a picture of me with out even ask me anything while I was waiting to open the bank,,, I don't see that can be appropriate!!Super kind service!! The senior manager can speak Korean as well !! 😆 Thank you! …They have the worst hours and frequently don't have enough staff to help customers during the day. You have to be sure the manager is there if you need help with any larger transactions. It's a complete hassle.Its just a bad branch run by bad people. I never had a decent experience here. I'll drive out of the way to go to another branch.Worst Bank of America in the entire world, and believe me, I've been to a lot of places.

542,Bank of America,"11288 Westheimer Rd, Houston, TX 77042",Houston,"I made a deposit into my business account at this location. Teller told me that the money will available next day, at the same night I received an email from BOA said that my check put on hold for 12 days . (deposit on 9/1 note  of available on 9/13)
Teller shouldn't tell customer if she doesn't know available date.
If I know BOA put my check on hold that long, I should go to sender bank to cash my check, in that case I don't have to wait for more than 10 days for BOA release my fund.
I hope this mesage reach out to whoever at BOA to improve the service to banking customers.
Please note that my check was from insurance company paid to my business. So it wasn't bad check and don't need to take that long to verify.Maria was awesome attentive understanding of my needs. I like this location I would like to tell people to come see Maria at Alief branch....she will give you a great service 😀 👍 …Slow af I’ve been here for an hour only one lady working at the counter and she taking her sweet time …service is terrible due to long lines and only two tellers
Tellers are nice thoughMaria she is good  and responsible she resolved our problems on time and good communication thank youThis review covers 4 experiences that all deserve a zero star rating. Our first visit was to open a checking account. The employee that set up the account input our address wrong, so we never received our debit cards. Second visit was to rectify that mistake but they only changed the physical address and not the mailing address, so once again a new set of debit cards were mailed to the wrong address. Third visit, we get the mailing address corrected. We also present financial paperwork that requires a signature guarantor, so the employee sets up an appointment for the following week with a specialist. Which brings us to the fourth experience today, when we show up for our appointment with a specialist and present the paperwork, we are told that she can not provide the service that we specifically requested the week before. We were advised to seek a financial advisor at a different bank and we will take that advise for every future banking need.I've been banking with Bank of America over 40 years. The attitude in this branch and lack of willingness to serve my needs caused me to seek another bank. Credit Unions are the answer. Don't mess with the arrogance of these big banks.Maria Ventura Mender .she work very Good .Customer service at this bank is the worst at all BoA locations that I've ever visited. The banker name Deborah is so slow and incompetence. I told her I do not want $20 bill, she said there is no $20 in the money stack, but turn out there was 20 of them. She also gave me hard time when I withdraw money from my business account. She said my name did not show up on my account, when my business debit card clearly show my name, along with my driver license. Can't believe it.Bad service and the lady today was rude. Waste my time to get in line twice but still not complete the transaction.I asked for a bank letter it's  been one month and I never received it. I called the national line they asked me to go back to the branch to have the letter printed. I went to the branch no one there seemed to know what I was talking about. When I decided to record our exchanges the on-site manager said she will call the cops on me if I don't leave.Too bad I can't give it zero stars. Over 20 minutes standing in line waiting for a teller. In my opinion, you'd think that by ripping people off an hour's worth of minimum wage to cash checks, they'd hire more tellers. Absolutely pathetic service.Bad service. Too slow. Waste my timeThey were very friendly and helpful.One clerk long lines. Bad service service feeling. Good think I don't bank here. Just depositing for someone elseThe worse branch to open an account with.
The banker is rude her customer service is ZERO I wonder how she got hire there.Friendly and enthusiastic staff, Ms. Tam.  I appreciate Ms Tam's way of workingVery slow usually 1 tellerThis location is horrible one person working at the counter and long line waiting , I gave one star that better should be noneVery bad experience, not organised , waiting more than 1 hour with no results and get back with online support call they solved everything👎🏻 …attention too slow staff very slow to attend and change checksLow on staff, long line and wait timesThere is none.Worst service ever.Bad customer service smhGoodBad serviceMaria Ventura Mendez and Moon-Nguyet Troung I am very satisfied with the service you gave me, thank you Bank of America for having professional peopleExcellent service I received from Miss Maria Ventura Mendez, very attentive, friendly, helpful, very cordial, the best attention I have received in a bank.The Chinese man at the entrance is super rude, they should find a better person to serve","Positives:

543,Bank of America,"6344 Telephone Rd, Houston, TX 77087",Houston,"This was my first ever bad experience with BOA. I tried to do a wire transfer on my BOA app. Which I couldn't complete there unlike the Chase app. I called in and was instructed to do it in a branch. I got there at 4:45 pm . I know I was cutting close to their 5pm closing time.  This was not a planned stop at all none the less  I was there at that time.  I was flat-out told no it could not be done at that time. I would need to make an appointment. Their  last time for a appointment was at 4:30. I'm thinking what's the difference between 4:30 and 4:45. They just didn't want to do it due to their closing time. I told them they could schedule the transfer to be effective the next day because I was traveling the next day at 3am. I made not a difference at all. They were stone faced and stuck to their guns.. when I called the 800# back, I was told I didn't need an appointment to make a transfer, it was a walk in service. That branch at  hwy 6 @ bissonett will never see my face again.. I was going to close my account but I decided not to make an impulsive decision like that.Malik was really helpful! Such a great worker!! Helped with us with every question we had!! He did a really good job on helping my husband manage his account, even helped him apply for a credit card!!!! More people like Malik !!!Bank of America hire more staff and pay them well for goodness sakes. Why do we, the customers have to suffer all the time waiting in long lines to be attended to? Today, 12/31/21 I stood in line for over 30 minutes just to cash a check, it was very hot in the bank with only 2 tellers and a long line of customers. I asked for water and was offered a cup instead of a bottle of chilled water. You guys should anticipate a long line with the holidays and either staff appropriately or offer chilled water at the least. You guys keep disappointing me more and more, watch me switch banks soonest.I needed to see a banker for some paperwork so i went in the morning without appointment but they were cooperating with me and i was able to see the banker and solved my problem. the employees were very friendly and professional it was quick in and OutSeriouslllyyy understaffed location. Only 1 banker for like 15+ people waiting in the lobby. No concept of timing each client so they can speed up. After seeing 1 client the banker takes their sweet time on their desk before calling the next person. A 5 minute task can take you more than an 1+ hour of wait. This is unacceptable! I walk into a chase bank nearby and they are super efficient. This location definitely needs new management!I have been waiting in line for over 45 minutes to deposit a check. Only 2 tellers dealing with 2 customers for over 20 minutes. Poor customer service! This is absurd !Rose is a 30-year teller work full-time and is basically working part-time

Martin is a service representative that studying for his CFA

Jonathan Davila is a senior service representative

He's been there ten years

You get to know the people there will be treated really well

There's always a line

I also noticed that people that were picking up the cash it took them at least 30 minutes

Armored car that was outside and then they have a full-time security guard that walks the front of the Bank of America back and forth back and forth

There's some video of what the lobby looks like

Some pictures of the personal bankers

There's always a greeterMalik provided me with excellent service today! I appreciate your kind assistance.Terrible service. She says for wire transfer i need to wait for 2-2.5 hrs. Are you joking. She says there is another bank of america. The funny part is there was no one in the lobby waiting. I told the lady is your job is sending customers to another bank of america locations.Worst customer service ever !!! Only one bank teller with a line wrapped around the bank almost outside. Another lady could be helping but decided not to intervene even after the teller asked her for help. Bank Of America do better !!!!!!I went to this branch to deposit money and they “accidentally”  deposit into the wrong accountMy experience at the branch has been great. Compared to other Bank of America branches this location gets more appointments and longer lines but that doesn't take away from their excellent customer service.Today I had my first and good experience with this branch, especially with teller LASHONDA. She is very nice and helpful. Applause to such a wonderful team and kind people !!!Amazing Branch Services Best staff you can meet to finalise all your Banking requirementsWhoever thought these couches were comfortable are clearly hateful. Or cheap.

And why isn’t there more staff at these kinds of places?? You can get here first thing in the morning and be here all day. Smh. Can’t even get a slot in for an appointmentAbsolutely horrible bank expect at least an hour wait when coming in can't even facilitate regular transactions in a semi timely mannerLong lines 1 taller working 7 people opening account but no one service them..then when you get to window she asked why you don't have a bank acc with us  hear like Really!!...Drive through experience 5 rating.People work over there impolite

544,Bank of America,"1025 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX 77030",Houston,"Worst customer service Ever, very unprofessional and they just denied on me saving account , and pretty much sent me to another bank ! I was going to put cash money on saving yeld, they said you know what, has to be on the name of your business no your name, sorry , hahaha .
Monkey business !!!
Shame for BofA !!!!!!!!!!!The worst bank to make business with. No parking first of all second. You always have to make appointments and they don't see you on time. Walk in and will wait for an hour or more. They close the doors 15 minutes before closing time. Just horribleWhen will BofA remember that meritocracy matters? Just spent 5 mins waiting for a diversity-hire teller to fumble her way through a customer's simple cash withdrawal. Alas, BofA's low-IQ teller couldn't figure it out, so I left to find a different location.  Anti-White hatred on full display in this location. Not one White employee today.I frequent this location for my job. Last week I went at least one hour before closing and the bank was closed.  There wasn't any notice on the door. I'm not surprised though, after all, this is Bank of America. It's the worst bank in my eyes.  I frequent many banks due to my job and this is by far THE worst.  Not sure why people bank here when there are soooooo many much better options.  One time I was there to make a deposit for my job and it was extremely crowded. To my surprise the guy that greeted the customers at the front came to assist me, however he told me that he would email me the receipt. Well, who's to prove that I even gave you a deposit if you don't provide me with a paper receipt upon deposit? You could easily say that I didn't make a deposit.  I declined. He was being too lazy to go in the back to retrieve the receipt.

No drive thru, always a long wait, not enough tellers and some branches close too early.  I personally would never bank here.  My years of doing bank runs for business, I know which banks just don't cut it and boa is number #1.Car followed me from this location and robbed my car. Now I am out of my money and damaged car. Seems like it is not the first time it happens at this location yet there is no extra security. With all the banks they have closed now on Saturdays you would think the few that are open would provide some sense of security .

Will be switching to a different bank since BAnk of America seems to not care about its customers.seriously? they will set some safety standards to “protect” you when you making a deposit to the bank. Yes, you heard it right. Making deposit now become a challenge with Bank of America and especially this location. Life could not be harder and my experience repeated and repeated still after 4 years!   Bank of America you deserve my m finger.  You make me a person I used to hate.I was waiting for around 30 minutes for attention, the internet was supposed not working, just 2 people. Mr. Tai does not want to help me, he's not professional. How bad it made me feel when he spoke to me with a very bad attitude. Finally, they said just call for attention. 42 minutes and they don't helpme.I have never seen a bank like this in my entire life been trying to call them for like 2 days and no one's bothered to receive a call. Worst banking experience gonna close my account from bofa!When busy don’t go to this place, this lady named mya is very rude and told me to shush and wouldn’t help me😠, I’m very disgusted with her service …8 people ahead of me in line. 1 teller. BOA is the worst bank I’ve ever dealt with. First location I stopped at was closed before the posted business hours.We been visiting this location on Saturday. And service provides by Itzel was awesome!!She is very good job.It amazes me how a bank can’t answer the phone. Unprofessional and pitiful.Very kind and fast servWas very nice not to far from us.","Positives:
- Service provided by Itzel on Saturday was excellent
- Location is convenient and not far
- Some employees are kind and provide fast service
- The bank offers safety standards for making deposits

Room for improvement:
- Customer service is described as the worst, unprofessional, and rude
- Long wait times and not enough tellers
- Some branches close too early
- Lack of parking and drive-thru options
- The bank was closed without notice on one occasion
- Difficulty reaching customer service by phone

545,Bank of America,"11814 Bellaire Blvd, Houston, TX 77072",Houston,"Horrible, horrible service with making a mere cash deposit! One tellerand it appears no one else can assist with the lines as long as they are. No one even asks what person's transactions were just letting the line grow longer and longer.The line was out the door. They have one teller working on a Saturday. Another person was back there standing with the one teller. If that person is in training, pick a different day. Go to any other location. Ended up driving to a different location and making my deposit at an ATM. The ATM only allows so many bills at a time so I had to break it into a bunch of different deposits and even that was better than standing in that lineNot sure why the review is so low here.
Mr Kazuyoshi Alex Kimura was so always so nice and ALWAYS went above and  beyond to help me. Such a kind hearted person.
Also the lady who helped me at the register was sweet and so was the young guy who helped me in the business department.I had a wonderful experience!!! Odalys was the one who assisted me with opening a new checklist account!!! As soon as we walked in we were greeted by a gentleman and a young lady (did not get the names) Overall everyone was nice and welcoming!!Made an appointment for 10 am doors opened a few minutes late, I was not helped at the time of my meeting. I was asked to sit down and all this just to change a PIN number on my Buisness debit card. Honestly this is the dumbs thing I’ve ever seen.I always wonder the reason why Bank of America branches having low reviews by clients/visitors, I never experience any issue with BOF, they are always professional & friendly

In this branch we have been treated by Odalys , she was professional, welcoming, did very good job.

ThanksVery helpful options provided to our clients when they are looking to finance their backyard project with our company. We appreciate the information and assistance. Thank you Hristo & team! Best, Cristina (Marketing associate)Brittany was super kind and the service was amazingI had the pleasure of speaking with Marwa Muraywed. She was very professional and handled every problem I had with a sense of urgency. She was about to get off work, but refused to go until all my problems were resolved and made sure I was very satisfied. I would recommend this branch to anyone. So if you need a banker with great customer service and professionalism just stop in and ask for Marwa. She will definitely take care of you..Always slow!

546,Bank of America,"9245 S Texas 6, Houston, TX 77083",Houston,"THE WORST BRANCH IN THE LOOP. I went to negotiate a Bank of America cashier's check written out to me and was told since it was dated over 90 days, I could not deposit it. I asked the teller to please ask someone who knew what he/she is doing, I was then told it would take an hour to finish the transaction. I told them that was ludicrous, why would it take an hour to deposit a cashier's check and how their service was really poor and the most inept in the inner loop, at this point the bank manager Gregory McClendon flat out refused to complete the transaction, pushed the cashier's check and deposit slip back at me and asked me to ""go to a better branch then."" He even threatened to call the cops on me if I did not leave. Well, I left and went to a much better branch, the one on Washington Avenue. The entire transaction from walk in to walk out took less than 20 minutes.  Bank of America should be ashamed of the West Gray branch. It has gone to the dogs. The entire staff needs retraining, including the manager who sets such a poor tone from the top.I used to love this branch, but my experiences lately have been awful, and I may change banks.
Yes, we are all effected by Covid, but there is no excuse for making contact with your bank so difficult. one has to try again and again to get someone on the phone, there is no notary, and one has to make an appointment to see someone.
i had an appointment at 2.30 today. I am disabled and got a cab. On getting there the bank was closed due to NO RUNNING WATER!
Why didn""t someone notify me, so that I didn't waste money and time.
I actually cried, and the cab took me home again.
Miriam Murphy, a customer for many years.Update - Funny how they reach out on google reviews right away. They had their chance in the branch. This is not a normal bank. Their policies are terrible. Not the normal customer service you'd receive anywhere else!

Worst customer service! Not just this branch but all of Bank of America is awful! Other banks don't have such stringent rules. Constantly can't get anything done. Countless hours wasted and finally will be switching banks!I don’t understand why a bank has to open at 10 AM and closes at 4 PM while most people are at work within those hours!!Why this location is still open if it has less than 2 stars !!!!

I requested a letter from this location last week
They said it should be ready within 4 days and that they will call me
Ever since I’ve been ghosted
I called 13 times (literally) in a different times/days and no one never answer the phone!!!

I’m so thinking to close my accounts with them and go to a different bank
DisappointedEvery time I have visited this branch, they have been courteous, extremely helpful and professional. I recommend you visit this branch and see Dathne for your banking needs.Why is this branch, the only one NOT open on Saturdays? Why is this branch the ONLY one open at 10am? Why not 9am like the other locations?No notary public at this location? 🙄 …This location arrive is Terrible!Trashy bankOnly one person serving what bad service","Positives:
- Courteous, helpful, and professional staff mentioned in one review
- Quick transaction time at another branch
- Positive experience in previous visits to the branch

Room for improvement:
- Poor service and lack of knowledge from the staff, as mentioned in one review
- Difficulty in making contact with the bank via phone
- Inconvenience caused by branch closure due to lack of running water
- Unavailability of a notary public at the branch
- Limited hours of operation, conflicting with typical work hours

Miscellaneous:
- Mixed reviews with some recommending the branch and others expressing disappointment
- Mention of switching banks due to dissatisfaction with Bank of America's policies and customer service
- Complaints about the branch being the only one not open on Saturdays, opening at 10 AM instead of 9 AM, and having only one person serving customers"

548,Bank of America,"630 Meyerland Plaza Mall, Houston, TX 77096",Houston,"I wouldn't give you any stars, the truth is, very bad service. My wife and I have been customers at this bank for many years. We made an appointment 2 days before for a house loan. When my wife went to the appointment, the person at the desk said she didn't have any. appointment above made fun of her this happened on 7/13/2023 the appointment Hera at 9 am I hope this does not happen again and they change to that kind of people who do not help in the business for me. neither to youI had an amazing experience with this company. The customer service provided by Rehana was outstanding , I was so pleased with the service I received from this business. She went above and beyond to help me find the perfect credit card .If I could give this branch 1 star I would. I deposited money into their atm about a week ago and the atm ate it. Now I’m coming into deposit money- 3 tellers with a line out of the door. 1 teller decides to leave, with the line out of the door. What a wasted branchDefinitely discriminatory practices at this location. I never have to show my ID at the suburban locations and even with my debit card and my pin, I have to pull out my ID at this location.  They wouldn’t let me withdraw money from a pending cash transfer from PayPal so instead I had to go outside to get my money from the ATM for everyone to see and let’s be real, Spring Branch and Long Point can be dangerous. No other locations do this. Lots of micro aggressions and just because the tellers and staff are Hispanic doesn’t mean they can’t be racist or treat working class people as inferior.lets regard the service, but this location is probably the safest bank in houston with HPD right next door, never have to worry about getting robbedThe ATM never works. I am tired of making trips for nothing.They don’t closed at 5 pm they closed 20 or more minutes before even with customers over there. Changes your schedule to the real one! Don’t make people drive to this location. Bad management for sure.The extended hours that they advertise is a lie. Expect their hours to be 10-4 just like every other location.Love always going with Julia she’s the best representative for BOA and they are always willing to help!Two tellers and a lobby filled with customers very unacceptable for a Monday.A little late but excellent service from Karina
Thank you","Positives:

549,Bank of America,"1905 W Gray St, Houston, TX 77019",Houston,"Terrible experience. ATM didn't work, I saw the message too late and It withheld my card. During opening hours I went with paperwork to get my card back and they refused to give it back to me. Now I'm in a foreign Country with no credit card. I tried to explain my great difficulty to the manager, at the beginning she was kind but in the face of my understandable insistence she was not very courteous in the end. I understand the general rules but I think it's also very important not to harm people for a problem with their ATM, if it was broken It shouldn't have taken my card or it should have given it back to me. This is unbelievable and ruining a little bit my vacation in the wonderful USA.This bank is appalling. I have never known such inefficiency and downright incompetence. They are so bad it is dangerous!!!
Maria and Donag have been trying to clear a transaction for over 8 weeks!!! And an international transfer for nearly 3 weeks!!! In the meantime my bills are getting unpaid and all I get is apologies and assurances that the money ""will be in tomorrow"" To date I am still waiting. I wouldn't bother with this bank. Go to Chase!!Bank of America has been falling by the wayside in service. Not a great place to do business. Looking for other banking options for checking, savings, investment, home and autoNo wonder their rating is so bad, I went to deposit a dwelling check we received from our insurance company and was endorsed by the mortgage company already, and they told me they can’t do it cause there are two names on the check, you don’t need to be banker to know that as long as the check is endorsed by the other party and has both parties signatures, is live and can be cashed. they even called their manager, SHIVA, and she was saying the same nonsense, I left and went to another branch, and they deposited the check right awayI came to the bank to do an international transfer. The lady in the lobby told me they don’t have any appointments except the customer they are helping. However, when the other staff became available, she came to me to ask what service I need. Once she heard what I need, she immediately told me she has an appointment coming in and she doesn’t know if she can help me.Then she jumped in the room and never came out. I had to sit there forever. This place either has a race prejudice issue or these people are snobby . Horrible service !!!!This is the second time in a month that this place doesn’t open on time (should open at 9 and it’s almost 9:30). I don’t know who’s running this but they need to be fired! And the horrible part is that it’s busy too so clearly something needs to be done to fix the situation.Absolutely ridiculous, have three employees processing one customer for 20+ minutes. Not opening another line. As soon as they finish the customer the other 2 employees leave and let the 1 remaining teller deal with the 10people in line. With only poor reviews in the review history you would think lessons had been learned. Just stay away.They do not care about their customers. They have 1 teller on duty at all times unless its lunch time and then while the teller is on break they shut down the teller desk. There are several other employees in the bank but they will not help you with normal banking needs like depositing a check, withdrawing money or a cashiers check. The wait is backed up longer than a ride at Disney World. You will wait at least 30 minutes every time you walk into that place. Just don't do it. Probably best to not bank with BoA. They don't seem to care about this issue so it must be happening at other branches also.I pay for goods and or services: this is the most basic building block of economics. One of the services that I pay for is to have my check cashed. There are 5 or 6 people in offices and the Teller lines have been unavailable for 2 days. Their solution is for me to make THEIR life easier and deposit it in the ATM. Which of course can take up to 2 business days to be available.Slow pace with one teller. Second teller joined but line wasn't moving as fast. This branch of BoA was my very first bank and I've been going out of my way to go there and be loyal, but this was my last visit.At location because the last weekend before Christmas, the Bank of America at HEB and Bunker Hill/I-10 lost the IT systems.  Then today called about a check, 27 minute wait, passed to check dept. - it hung up on me.mid. im so bored waiting for a teller right nowRetail banking at its worst. They frankly provide a disservice here.Not enough tellers and poor customer serviceThey are friendly with usWaste of location","Positives:
- Friendly customer service
- Staff initially kind and courteous
- Other branch was able to deposit check with two names

Room for improvement:
- ATM not working and withholding card, causing inconvenience

550,Bank of America,"7620 N Shepherd Dr, Houston, TX 77088",Houston,"Came here for the first time and they processed my money order fairly quickly! :)
It’s good to get things done fast!
Keep it up the good work! 🙂
Come experience the good
Cheers 🥂They are open even on Saturday. Good and quick service. Call and take Appointment so that you don’t have wait for long. They definitely need for cashier.The laziness in the employees here is absurd. 10 people in the line and only one receptionist. There are two employees in the back talking and chatting while people are trying to get places. We expect high quality and fast service not lazy employees who would talk about their lives rather than respecting our time.Ella was really helpful today and provided an outstanding service, I really appreciate how easy she made the process for meDo NOT do business with any Bank of America. We had an account with them and when we tried to close it, they would not release our funds for months. This is the worst bank in the universe.This cashier (might be Cesar, young Hispanic kid) have 0 customer service skills. Didn’t ask me to come to the counter, didn’t say hello, with straight face says do this, do that, didn’t say we are finished, very condescending tone. He was more interested in talking with coworkers, that’s the only time I saw him smiling, towards his coworkers. When talking to me, went back to straight face and ignorant tone. Never been treated this dry in any bank, and I have been banking with this bank for over 10 years atleast.There are super lazy staff with no respect to the time of customer! We checked in at 02:30pm today. They told us it would be better to come back 1 hour later. We came back at 03:30pm again and waited 45 minutes to visit a bank clerk, but they responded to another customer! So we had to leave there without any response and result! :(
I don’t offer this branch absolutely.Every time I come in for a transaction they have 1 teller. The wait is terrible and the employees are uninformed. Location is the only reason I'm here.Literally the worst location and customer service. Always long waitsArrived at the bank hoping for at least a good experience but in line waiting for 44 minutes until I finally get my turn. I was there for a change order and when the lady teller ask me to confirm the amount, it was more than what I was asking for. I told her that the amount was wrong so had to start the process over again. Lots of staff at this location but people just walking around acting like they are busy. One teller and over 10 people in line is ridiculous. No excuse to put this kind of pressure on 1 teller when 4-5 other staff members walking around not doing anything.Came in to replace lost business card. Adely and Carolina were utterly useless and unprofessional. Get better people!!I visited the store to see what options I had for an temporary card due to fraudulent activity. Adriana the teller at the time was not courteous and unprofessional. I was able to speak to the manager whom was very sincere and apologetic. Needless to say I will not return to this location.I went to deposit cash into another account that's not mine. I was told I could not do this. I had to first deposit into my account and the transfer. I opened an account here specifically because I have to be a member to deposit into another members account. I have literally done this process for more than 2 years to pay my rent. My cash deposit was available immediately and then transferred just to have a hold placed!!!. Ridiculous, useless and stupid. There was no reason for a hold. I've deposit funds into that members account atleast 20 times. He now has to wait on his money I promised the same day.
Very disappointing and misleading. I feel like the money was intentionally held for shadow banking. 💰Horrible customer service. What business center stops providing services 15 mins before business hours ends. This is such a lazy place with lazy customer service. Go to chase and you will be better ofIf you are walk in and try to open an account for your small business don’t go this location without an appointment because they won’t help.No body even said hi or that they would help me in a minute. Already have another bank account open elsewhere. Ready to move all my money to it. If I were you I'd take my hard earned money and run!20 people in line and only one rep ...this is crazy
However,  mona the rep was very friendly and helpful,  she went out of her way to secure me ones ..No tellers today??  Only 1 person at the windows with 7 people in line. Waited 40 min and still 2 people in front of me...  yeah I'm typing this while in line..Super long lines only one person taking care of the line!!!!! Like they don’t have enough money to pay other personal to help out. Don’t open an account with this bank!!!!!So BoA allows your account to be hacked,  tells you about it then closes your cards . But they do not issue temporary cards anymore and will put you in line to 'see ' if you qualify for access to a digital card . What a joke .traditional banking system is trash 👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽 …The most incompetent tellers and employees I've ever witnessed.  Took over 35 minutes to make a single deposit.Please hire more tellers or cross train your bankers.worst bank ever .. no customer service and the banker who did my account forget to send my cards !!! when u call customer service takes hours to reach them ..Unbelievable they close doors 30 min bef 5pmI set an appointment and they did not honor my time. Very disappointedConsistently a bad experienceBad attitude from the banker .Excellent attention from the supervisor Carolina and Mr. Jhonatan, very professional and kind, I wish I could give them 10 stars.

I truly appreciate the service yesterday9/2/23
He is a great banker and human being !It is always a pleasure when I meet with Ms Petal for my banking needs. She is always very officious and take out any form of anxiety I might have when transacting business with your bank. Very knowledgeable and she does have this  'ready to help' character about her. Thank you very much for your calming effect on me anytime we meet. I appreciate.Went in there to go get a cashier's check. There were no lines, the customer service rep was very helpful and professional. A very great improvement from before. I was done within 20 minutes, very pleasantly surprised.The Indian woman teller is not only rude but also unprofessional. How is she started yelling about my personal banking business through the window while other customers were around, hearing everything, she could have toned it down. No one need to hear about my personal banking. The branch’s manager needs to fired her already, it was totally unacceptable.I am always in awe of the level of customer service in this particular branch.
One of the staff, Ms. HETHL PATEL is an exceptional and easy to deal staff.
Keep the great Job.Never been on this location but Coleen was very kind to direct me to Chioma in order to make my transaction. Will definitely come back to this branch from now on.
Hope many other Bofa locations get to learn from this magnificent customer service.Hi, I like the service in Bank of america special this branch. I spoke with Hetal Patel she is so kind and friendly, and my mum speaks English little, so hetal spoke with her slowly and when my mom didn't understand she repeated again slowly one and two and three times this was so kind.Hetal Patel was extremely helpful and helped me save $30 by not doing a wire transfer , instead I did a cashier checkHetal and Amy were very kind to process my transactions as usual, Also Hetal was able to get me some answers to my questions about my acct. I hope everyone on the banks are like them.Hetal Patel, I really preciated what she did
She help me with all heart
And i’m so happy when I talk with her.
Thank u Hetal <3Hetal has a great costumer service and she helped a lot in the consultations that I needed! :)
I recommend her like banker.Always a pleasure at this location, I have came to this location pretty much every Saturday since October of 2017, and always happen to fall in the hands of Miss Hetal Patel who is just delightful! She gives a warm welcome every time as well as makes me feel very great because she remembers me every time as well as asks about me and my coworkers that come to this location. She definitely deserves a raise! Thanks again for the great serviceI wish I could give them 0 stars. The worst bank and branch ever. The manager is really rude and talk to people shouting and screaming. I spent one hour here to close my account and withdraw my money and they didn’t do it. 🤮 The banker had to make about 4 calls just to close the account and she couldn’t. 🤯 …I just sat here and watched the main banker yell at another employee in front of everyone!! This will be my last time coming to this location! She was very rude and tacky!!Hetal Patel was very helpful and professional with addressing my concern regarding my account . I've been getting transferred from one department to another when calling customer service & no one helped me with the fraud happened to me. Hetal was very patient and has been a great help!the level of customer service in this branch of the bank, a complete zero! very displeased!Thank you Ms Patel for being patient and friendly. We appreciate your hard work :)Why is there a phone number to call At this location? Nobody never answer the phone. All day everyday all the representative are assisting other customers. 😫😫😣😣😖😖 …I don't know why I here these negative comments,I've been with them a while and I've had no problems,WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!
I went in today at around 4pm in need of scheduled appointment to fix my business account login issue and I was uncomfortable and felt completely embarrassed am very disappointed with the service today even the way he was talking unprofessional and unethical name of the manager is John.Try to cash my check because I am not customer they refuse to make the check from company they have account with  them but they have rules when i ask him for written paper about the rules he  talking about he told me paper i can give it to youHorrible! Always a long line to see bank tellers no matter what days/times. Need to have more tellers. I will not come to this branch anymore.This location is always up and running the issue is going there at night there is not enough light and security considering the jugging incidents that are going on I really think they should have visible security cameras pointed very conspicuously right at the ATM lines and the stand-up standalone ATM in the front of the buildingH etal Patel had a very good serviceThe lady teller at the far left corner was so accommodating and super nice to my request this morning when I made my withdrawal. Thank you for that.Thanks to chioma and  Hetalia for their assistance.I wish I could give them a 0 is really frustrating bc they have promotions going on for new customer that opens new acct and they don’t even offer them I have try to get in contact with the lady that helped me out she don’t even answer her phone or if u call the branch nobody answersToday Saturday I need to open new small businesses account and closest branch to my house is this location (I don’t  have car with me I walk there) when I arrived there the guy told me I have no body to help you ,pal you work for billion dolar company one of the biggest bank in America and you don’t have no body to help me good business right on!!The worst service I have ever had in a bank. I made an appointment to do some procedures with a notary and after asking permission at work to attend the appointment they told me that they did not have a notary that I had not arrived that I was sick. I think they may have been warned.Devin Mayfield and Hetal
Both of them do wonderful services.
I deeply appreciate their services.! It took me 20 minutes to make a DEPOSIT!!!!! why do you have 1 teller and have to VERIFY a deposit!?!?! And on top of that they denied the deposit!!! Since when is it up to the branch employees to decide whether or not to accept a deposit?! I HATE THIS BANK.DO NOT USE THE ATM HERE!! I MADE A DEPOSIT AND THEY PUT A CHARGEBACK ON THE CASH I DEPOSITED!! DO NOT COME HERE!! I’ve had to put a claim on this and they don’t answer their phones EVER!Worst customer service ever.I come in to this location and everything is just one person in the counter and a lot of "" bankers"" this is ridiculous and the line is longHaving a small business you can’t even withdraw your own money . Never coming here againGreat customer service, John is amazing. Like going to this location.ATM was out of order.Very slow staff, not professional manager, needs improvement.Nice service.Don’t come to this location terrible experience1 tellerNothing but 20 bills ???Good experienceVery good service from all the staff, I recommend Agent Domingo, he treated me in a very professional manner.The worst experience of my life, I went to withdraw a large amount of cash in the morning and an executive told me that if I wasn't afraid to withdraw so much cash, I should be careful later when I left and headed to my destination, they broke the glass of my car. to try to rob me, luckily they did not succeed, the person had the address where I was going and the amount I had. They only attacked my matter when on the sides I had cars with more value and many more things...it is clear that bank personnel are involved It was a direct attack, very carefulExcellent very professional services I recommend HetalI went to this bank to ask a question about a check that they sent me from an insurance company and a tall bald man was very rude and took me out of his office and did not let me explain what I needed.

My experience with them has always been excellent.
Big thanks to the entire staff .Absolutely terrible customer service would leave 0 stars if possible. I recently lost my phone and debit card but luckily still had my ID. Went to withdraw some money to hold me over until I can get my phone replaced  and was denied access to my funds despite being able to provide passport, current address on file with boa and social security number. Was treated very rudely by the manager who point blank denied me access to my hard earned funds despite being dire need. I then called BOA customer service and told them about the sitiuation and they said they could not understand why I am being denied access despite me having govt issued ID Went to another BOA location and they accepted my ID and allowed me to withdraw money with no issue. There seems to be no uniform policy that this branch follows in terms of handling Never been treated this poorly before and will be taking my business elsewhereCustomer service at this branch and boa in general is completely unsatisfactory for a business person.  It's not that the agents are rude or anything it's just they are non-existent. Today was the third time I have been grossly disappointed walking into this location. There was not one single bank teller available in the building so they told me it was ATM service only.  That's unacceptable when all my money and my needs for business transactions exceed your ability to properly staff your facility.  I will be taking my two personal accounts and three business accounts elsewhere.The people here are so rude! My mother tried to make a deposit she needed help since she only knows Spanish, the only teller turned her away  she put me on FaceTime so I could explain to the other guy what she needed and he just said no and walked away, never came back no one else tried to help. She just stood there not knowing what to do and everyone ignoring herNever more than one teller working. Always long lines. The one teller that is always here needs help, although she is always pleasant and helpful. When I arrived 10 plus people waiting in line. You can't use the ATM if you have to have make a cash transaction to get changeOnly one person working in the window with big lines worst place I Been .That facility is very understaffed.
Appointments are over a week out for simple requests.Typical Bank of American (No service) 3 pm in the afternoon on a Friday and 1 teller helping customers while 9 people stand in line.. At least it’s consistent at every Bank of America they clearly do not care about customer. The reason I moved over 200 K away from Merrill because the affiliation and lack of service!I would give zero stars of I could.  It's rare I come into a branch but needed a transaction I couldn't do online nor ATM. The branch manager told me it'll be 15-20 mins before a teller could assist me!!! There was no customer in the line nor in the lobby. There was no teller behind the glass window either.I want to know why this bank only has one cashier working in the whole store every day. Saturday also? It takes sometimes 20 mi minutes for something  that should only take 5 to ten minutes.The worst customer service experience I have ever received. You need to hire employees asap!! One teller at 1:00pm on a Monday afternoon is not the best customer service.It was an employee name Jeremy, he was very rude and disrespectful. This location has the Worst customer service. They just take care of Vietnamese customers. All the rooms they were empty and they were talking to each other and not helping the customers at all. I’ve never had a such bad experience with any other Bank of America locations.They never answer their phones, they don't do notaries, they are horrible customer service here.  Awful place.I had an appointment for notary at 2:30 today. when went there  on time the lady who told me that she is a manager of the branch even though I discovered that she is not the manager. that she did not have a notary.1 didn't work but other didOne of the worst branches and banks. There are 15 people in line, one teller behind the desk. They are mean and unfriendly on too of this.My wife will be closing her account with them , the worst bank by far she has ever associated withBad customer serviceCan’t cash a cashiers check, what is the point of a cashiers check then?Bad serviceLong lines constantlyWorst service everLong lines and understaffed!!!!This bank works a rasist Chinese decriminates very ugly when one writes the checks in Spanish and when one speaks Spanish I went because I made a deposit to a person but I wouldn't even open an account with this bank and be treated by rude and arrogant people like Elte I asked to talk to someone and they told me it was the boss. I was disappointed and I was thinking of opening an account there. But I'm not crazyBANK OF AMERICA is one of the best banks in this wonderful country.","Positives:

553,Bank of America,"9754 Katy Fwy, Houston, TX 77055",Houston,"I walked in to the branch with our appointment, and had a very warm welcome. Had opened account with help of Map On and applied for credit card instantly, looking forward to have more banking with BOFA.
Thanks a lot for team in branch for excellent service.If I could give this location zero stars, I would. This place is not a real bank. Something is always going wrong here.
Whether it be the WIFI being down, ATM not working, not accepting cash or check withdrawals/deposits, cash advances, or get this….not having a bank teller on-site during BUSINESS HOURS. It makes no sense how a bank teller isn’t present. How are you as a bank, not able to provide the bare minimum for your customers? I don’t understand but what I do understand is why this specific location has terrible reviews. Well deserved. Why hasn’t corporate done anything. Replace the staff and you wouldn’t have such horrible reviews.The host is disgustingly rude, He is an older grumpy man who that sits at entrance. He has never been helpful, he has a look on his face as to be miserable and honestly prejudice and racist the way he treats me when I go.  I've recently had to move to the Energy Corridor area.  And I can say I hate this bank location! He is aggressive he came up to my face,,,yelling at me and as in to hit me..please review cameras. I started to call police!!  Luckily I had a real customer service agent on the phone who heard everything.  And I've never been afraid of fat man!  he tried really hard to intimidate me  He should not be working in any kind of customer service position.  I would love to hear back from someoneAbsolute trash customer service. Like others have said, if it could have zero stars, I would leave it.

My mom went in to close an account.  When we went in, there was only person in the entire front office and rudely asked what we needed. My mom politely said she just needed to close an account. He said she can’t do that because there are no tellers. HOW ARE THERE NO TELLERS AT A BANK.

He then told my mom to just Zelle or cash app the remaining balance and to come back at a better time.

The fact that nobody was around and the office was dark seemed extremely sketchy.

Will not be coming back here if my life depends on it. No thank you.Every time I come into this bank I leave out even more frustrated. Bank of America has terrible customer service and is constantly causing more problems than they are actually solving. I have been with BOA for over 5 years and it’s been hell every time an issue happens. Currently seeking a new banking institution. So done with their constant piss poor performance.It is quite apparent how awful this location is. The banker Louis was incredibly rude to me and glared at me the whole time. The manager Robert was incredibly defensive when I brought it to his attention and reading these reviews it is clear why. No customer service to be had here. An awful experience I wouldn’t wish on anyone. Bank of America needs to close this location from reading these horrendous reviews.Would give 0 if possible. Rude banker with little patience. Will never do business here. Oh one more thing, are they wearing UT and TAMU shirts just to shame these universities?My worst experience in my life. I took an online appointment about few weeks ago for today. I went there and the front was locked. I could see the employees inside and they were seeing me as well, However, no one came to me to say why the bank is closed. The stupidest part is they were seeing me and just smiling at me and kept walking, like they were making fun of me.this gata be the worst BOA location for banking period. Shame on BOA for such a miserable branch. I think time to move business to FROST/PNC or other regional banks....,
Yes sure Jennifer, your response is as incomplete and inadequate as your BOA location's service.

year 2023 .. a cashiers check for business should not take 1hour line..,  add more staff at windows you all have ...and please dont have dedicated business service teller if there not going to be one standing there...Looks like Reliability is not part of service anymore.I had multiple bad service experiences at this branch.  Even with an appointment I have to wait.  Teller is always gone.  I’m moving my account to Frost.Maria Ventura and the entire staff here have no regard for their customers!! We visited THREE branches of Bank of America to have notary service. Finally after 3 attempts I was finally able to get someone to assist. But the concern is they make you set up an appointment and then they will sit in the back and eat their lunch while you wait for 10 minutes when you’re already on their schedule. When they finally come to “help” they ALWAYS try to look for a problem or something wrong before they even TRY to help. Then Maria Ventura suggested that I go to UPS instead, when We have ALL of our accounts including business accounts with Bank of America. I truly expect better customer service from Bank of America but I guess that is a thing of the past.Hey, Map On was really helpful and kind. Great expirienceWorse BofA location, they can’t help with regular financial needs, it takes days to wait for an appointment to open a new account, and they have a ridiculously low limit to cash checks. No one at the front to help you! So, good luck figuring things out at this branch…The is absolutely annoying to go to this bank, everytime i go during peak hours
the teller booth is closed. If the associate is on lunch then have someone else cover for that hour. It is ridiculous that I can't get my banking doneBad attitude of the cashier plus he did his job very very extremely slow !!!!! Zero points for this bank!!Terrible customer service- the WORST I have ever experienced or heard about regarding a major bank. If I could give 0 stars, that would be my rating. It's sad and scary that they are managing people's money. You wait on the phone for HOURS, no one knows how to handle anything and you get different answers depending on who you talk to AND they do not follow up as promised. And when you go to a branch in person because you cannot get anywhere on the phone with them, that still is not helpful and you get to hear other customers voicing the same complaints...RUN, don't walk away from Bank of America!!!!!!!!!This has to be the most useless BoA branch. I’ve tried going in at different hours of the day and every time they either don’t have a teller available, or no one is in the lobby. I wish this wasn’t the closest branch to me. Too bad zero stars isn’t possible to post a review.Please kindly remove the call icon because nobody is never available to answer to phone. Why wasting our time ??Just don’t waste your time here. Did a currency change and they sent it back and just cancelled the transaction 5 minutes after I left. No email or call voicemail says it has a limit of 5 days. I even took a $280 loss on the exchange before my tripHorrible service!  I stood inside the lobby waiting on assistance as I could hear everyone in their office talking on the phone.  Nothing related to work, these were personal conversations.Not drive through do not waist your timeThis is not a bank. Is just an atmUnprofessional!!! Visited this branch around 1 , they said you can wait till 4 till bank close but can not guarantee we can serve you when i was the only one in bankMap on is amazing advisor ✅✅👍🏼👍🏼 …Very slow in the lobby, I've been waiting for over an hour, and only 3 people in front of me!!Worst one ever. No teller on Friday 2pmMaria, Thank you for your kindness.Excellent service and more attention from Luis Costa, very good communication, very friendly and efficient, 100% recommended 👍🏼

554,Bank of America,"2344 Hwy 6, Houston, TX 77077",Houston,"Worst experience ever, no one’s at the counter, be ready to wait in the line for at least 30minThey only had 1 bank teller waited for 30 min  line was just growing and growingThis is the worst experience I've ever had with a bank. They really tried to keep my money from me. I won't get into all the details but basically I had a large transaction on my business account and because of their negligence was forced to stay in Houston an extra night and lost at least 1 extra day of work.

I went to another location and didn't have half the issue I had here. Bank of America needs to CLOSE this location or completely start over with staff. I'm in the process of reporting them federally for their illegal practice of not giving me my money.

All of the reviews about 1 teller are accurate. There were about 15 people in line and 1 teller trying to help all those people. Meanwhile there were 4 other staff members doing pretty much nothing.

Save yourself the headache and go to any other location...seriously.David Martinez was the Relationship  Manger that assisted me in setting up my online bill pay. He was so patient and extremely helpful and walked me thru to setting up all my bills. I never felt rushed during the process. He was polite and professional. Thank you so much David!bad customer service, one person for 20 customersIncompetent workers. Just left and was told they couldn’t cash my check because it was an echeck, even though on the “echeck” it says clear as day cash in financial center. Went to another location and had 0 issues. Please be more informed and check with others before giving out misinformation.Terrible customer service!! Every time I come they always have one or two tellers working with a line of 20 and the manager doesn’t do anything about it. You would think because they don’t have drive thru they would have more tellers working but no! Avoid this location if you can because you will be here for at least an hour.Don’t have to say much for this place because there’s no good they don’t ever have enough staff for the amount of people who go through this place and it’s super slowbad service I been waiting in line for 30 mins and there is only one person working at the windowthey don’t have no taller at all they only have one window one 15 people waitingOne teller 20 people waiting.. I do not know if people do not want to work or BOFA do not want to pay.This bank lobby kid slow never has more than 2 tellers it takes for ever to get serviceOpen view for your security.The worst service, I'll have to wait 2 hours to get attendance, don't recommend.The worst BOA in the area! Long lines and they do not have enough tellers.I love this bank and the other banks are bad but this is the bank I loveOne teller 30 people in lineGoodTerrible customer service…Trashy bankThis bank every time I come here is always slow they are all round and round and I think they need more staff it is always slow Especially on Fridays we have a lot of community we need them to mobilize it is very slowBad service 27 online and only one cashier and business customers. And from the offices there is also only 1 agent serving and 6 clients. Long wait...Very quick service from the lady at the window, friendly and efficient.They never answerVery bad customer service, too many people, few cashiers, too much waitingIt does not work","Positives:

They refused to cash the check. It seems a lot of people are having issues of refusing to cash people's checks.

My father was treated horribly (he’s a senior citizen) was told that if he didn’t like the wait time he can go elsewhere keep in mind like many more other complaints only one teller was working at the time with the line reaching the lobby doors. Instead of treating your customers bad maybe y’all should consider changing the management at this branch. It’s obvious y’all need proper people skills if you can’t even talk to a customer. I’ll be returning soon to this branch to confront this individual that thinks he can speak to elderly people like they aren’t human beings. If BOA doesn’t teach him a lesson I will.Very bad service, there only one cashier almost all the time 😡😡😡😡😡😡 need more cashiers, the manager need to do something and this bank have a lot of customer. …Bank of America advertises free notary service for account holders.  I've had an account with Bank of America for longer than I can remember (that's actually a true statement!).  I went to get a letter notarized and was told I needed to have the notary signature block on it.  I ran home, added a notary signature block and returned to the bank.  Then I was told they were unwilling to notarize it, because the letter involved a monetary transaction with another bank.  I thought a notary was basically verifying your identity.  I had no less than five types of identity with me.  Yes, the staff was extremely courteous, but I had to drive to my credit union to get my letter notarized.The comments I read here before I came here scared me. But contrary to the comments, everything went very well and on time. I can't thank Annie and her friend enough. they were so polite and kind. Thanks you so much...The manager is so kind

558,Bank of America,"13331 TX-249, Houston, TX 77086",Houston,"Drive up atm machines are always broken down. Have to walk to the atm outside store in the most dangerous neighborhood in Houston.What is the point of having drive up ATM’s if they’re all out of service? There’s one toward the front that you have to park and walk up to in order to use. It’s not always safe to do that and weather isn’t always the kindest. I’ve never heard of this happening at any bank.My husband and I have a joint account at Bank of America but I cannot do anything for him but deposit money I cannot deposit checks I cannot do anyting also do not open a savings account with Bank of America if you make more than six transactions in a month they will charge you 40 bucks out your money. So you get charged for transferring your own money. I really don't like Bank Of AmericaThe staff here is amazing!

I had an incredibly difficult time with a large transaction at another location. I called and spoke to Ms. Rocelyn who was very knowledgeable and is great at de-escalation(I was already frustrated because the location on Federal's staff is completely unable to do their job).  She assured me that they would be able to resolve this issue that kept me in town an extra night.

When I got there Ms. Rocelyn was busy but she'd already informed Ms. Yvette of the issue and she got right on it to assist me.

Ms Yvette worked quickly and just when i thought we were done, we hit a roadblock. Instead of dismissing me she called over Mr. Jose and they put their heads together to resolve my issue.

Mr. Jose took us into an office and verified some info. Completed some setup and BOOM! transaction complete.

There were only 2 tellers but they served about 50 people in the hour we were there! They're quick, friendly, and know what they're doing

I don't know the ""standard"" for BofA customer service but they have to be surpassing it. Amazing experience here. The branch manager should know that they have an exemplary staff!There atm machines are always out of order. Go to any other area no problems.  Even Chase across the street do not have that problem. It is such an inconvenience to have to use an atm at the corner store for a fee smfhWe opened a checking account with BOA at Old spanish trail branch. There was a $200 bonus for opening the account. Ms. Yasmine Ali helped us open this account. We asked her about this bonus and she said that once we start the direct deposit, $200 will be credited to us after 3 direct deposit ie. 3 months. I followed through this and enquire again once our account was not credited. I emailed her 3-4 times and no response was received. As this branch is close to our home we went to branch and enquired. We were told that they are looking into matter and a ticket will be opened to response this. Nothing happened. We went at least 5 time and responded with same answer. In our last visit after ~1.5 years of account and at least 14 direct deposits later, we were told that this matter is closed and we will not receive the signing bonus. How could we trust this kind of Bank/Branch!!! It is a mental harassment and we will soon close our account as we can not trust this bank.I was 10 minutes late but Michele, the relationship banker was very friendly and handled my request very smoothly. The bank staff is very friendly.I might as well as to the bad reviews on this one. Yep. They are terrible.Not a bank i would recommend to use. After being a client for 15 years, I recently changed.

She makes wait business customers and first take 2-3 people from private accounts making wait business customers at the business line and there onother Teller available for private accounts at the same time. Employee can not create their own rules and procedures and if bank let them do it then bank going nowhere.
Then some time I have to deposit cash and they do not give receipt. I have to ask. They must to give receipt no matter what special for cash deposits.
And it is happen many times. May be that is why this branch have review with 2 stars. I wish I could give them 0 star.Stopped by Friday morning to do a wire transfer and was very pleased with the fast service from Fernando.. I was in and out within 15 mins… 5 stars
Returning Monday to do another transfer..Came to try to cash one of their checks and remembered why I stopped banking with them a long time ago. Me and another person who didn’t have accounts with them were told they couldn’t cash our checks due to “verification issues”, yet the guy in front of us was able to get his cash without hassle just for being a customer. I wonder why the verification system didn’t have issues then. You can just tell they’re lazy and the manager (red hair and glasses) don’t care to tend to everyone who walks in the door. I was thinking about opening a business account with them and wanted to talk to someone about it today after my transaction but I’m definitely staying away.

Just realized they ruined my check by scratching the print marks their machine did with pen instead of a professional stamp any other competent bank would use. Now I have to wait for a reprint of this check due to these people’s incompetence and laziness.I had a great visit thanks to Carissa, Jaime, and Beatrice. I initially visited only to open a business checking account, but Carissa went above and beyond to help me apply for a line of credit. Jaime helped me apply for merchant services, and Beatrice is a clever and friendly teller. Each one of these employees displayed the utmost respect for my time and small business.WORST BOA IN HOUSTON. All my husband wanted to do was deposit money into my account and the Teller told him he could not deposit since his name was not on the account. Went to a different BOA and got it done with no problem.Everytime i come here its just one line. I always get the ""Sorry its just one line today"" Whats the point of the business clients line and advertising if its never even open for what they say its for? smh Long lines never end here. WORST bank location to come to, go elsewhere

Why does this branch suck soooo bad, its like they try on purpose to take as much time from peoples day as possible. Business acct members are told they have all these so called perks but we dont! Same long lines each time, the business line is just a stunt! smh terrible terrible!I visited today to cash a check. I’m a customer with an account with BofA . I had a check that was drawn on Bank of America so therefore I came in to  cash the check at Bank of America. I questioned whether the check had the funds to cover so I took it into the bank. When I got there there was a line I waited in. I was interrogated while in line. I did not appreciate being questioned as to why I was there. What happened to privacy? I don’t want everybody in Bank of America to know while I’m there. Then when I responded that  I wanted to cash a check, the person asked to see the check. Why do you need to see my check? She responded to verify something or other. First of all do you think I was standing his line if I didn’t necessarily have to, I could’ve  easily done  a mobile deposit.  But for you to ask me to see the check it’s none of your business. I didn’t appreciate any of it. She said she was only trying to save me time. But unless you were going to cash my check yourself or skip the line and take me to the front you’re not saving me any time. Why I’m there is none of your business. If I needed your help I would have asked.Hands down one of the WORST banks ive ever had the unfortunate opportunity to step foot in. There isnt a day where the lines aren’t ridiculously long. Whether its extremely cold outside, or pouring down heavy rainfall : you can expect a like outside. The only time there wasnt a line outside , was when another person was managing but that only lasted about a week. This is extremely disappointing and I hope after years of customer complaints something changes.Most of my baking is done online or through the ATM. What I don’t  understand is why is it every time I go 2 of the 4 ATM’s are down? Also, why are they not able to give out 5 dollar bills anymore. That is so inconvenient!This is by far the worst bank in history. The lines are redundant, always one teller working, manager of the bank prefers to carry on a conversation in back with employees. Laughing about last night clubbingFebruary 10 9am I had an appointment and another person arrives behind me and they attend to her before me and they tell me to take a seat, which I did, I turned around and left. the name of the person who attended me was LILI or LILY VERY BAD ATTITUDEThis is the worst BOA ever. No matter what time you enter the bank there is a line to the door. It always takes me 45 minutes to receive service for a 2 minute transactionWent inside long wait on Monday morningIt's 12 o'clock and they are not  open even they are closing early on Xmas eve. They excuse because they still counting the draws.
Very poor managementVery crowded all the time.Low staff to long lineThe worst one very slowThe bank was empty, they did not attend to a couple of Hispanics at 11.20 am, because they were waiting for an appointment that came at 12 am. The banker Jorge told him that he could not attend them because the people who were in the box, were going to pass to his appointment, which was a lie, I complained with the hose and he did nothing, he only agreed with the liar who just yawned in his bed ""workplace"", lousy attention to the public!No client in the waiting room will not serve you if you do not bring an appointment. while the bankers with tablet in hand. Doing nothing.In this bank, customer service has unfortunately declined a lot and now it's lousy, they don't have enough tellers and above all they have to be friendly!!!!!","Positives:

560,Bank of America,"8110 W Sam Houston Pkwy S, Houston, TX 77072",Houston,"The staff was very attentive and I would like to thank Ms. Angelina Ruiz a lot for her services and for assisting me with my bank account. I had gone to numerous BOA branches in Houston and they kept giving me the runaround. But Angelina took the initiative and was able to help me with my account and provided me with additional information and resources. I had to take my time out to give her, her flowers because I'm grateful to have people like her to actually help people and not just push them to the side. Thank You!!!!I want to say that my mother and I went into the bank today, and we met the new manager, and she really shows her clients that she cares.  My mother doesn't speak English, she speaks Spanish felt very comfortable with the new manager who was able to speak to my mom in Spanish and explain everything to her.  Thank you for putting a Spanish speaking manager here in this bank. Mrs.Ruiz is the best.Just 1 teller was kept at the window making me wait for about 20 minutes for a simple cash withdrawal transaction. Why there were not 2 tellers at the window?
This is the same problem with the branch whenever you visit there.The New Financial Center Manager Angelina is Amazing the Most Professional person I have ever met at Bank Of America She is the reason I am moving my relationship over from First Convenience Bank, she a great asset to your company.Love the manager Angelina. She didn't hesitate in answering my mom's questions in Spanish. So happy to find a Bank with fluent Spanish speakers.Had a wonderful experience with katherine as she is very helpful, Professional and an overall happy person. Definitely a great banker would recommend you go with her, Thank you Katherine for the great customer service.They changed a lot, since I was here last time! Good job guys. Very professional and friendly. Especially KatherineThis place is #1 in negligent hiring, after a bad experience 2 years ago with a rude employee I decided to return today since it’s the most convenient place from my house, and sadly i just walked through another bad experience with “domingo chacon” not just bad attitude he have but also he threw the money back and waived his hand (bye) 🖐🏻 the moment i said i don’t have my ID, and stopped talking back to me like he’s doing me a favor, and when asked for a manager the manager tries to cover up his nasty attitude and acts like she’s taking notes and filing a complaint just so i can walk out, no comments! ❗️if this comes across someone who cares, wake up and watch your business.There are literally nine people in line right now and only one teller taking care of all of us. There’s another teller back they’re just looking at everyone. This is so inefficient and ridiculous. This is a very poorly run location. Let’s sayWorst bank at the worst branch EVER. The BS has been going on at this branch for years. Nothing is being done about it...look at these reviews and pictures. Obviously there is nobody that cares at BOA.I came here to get a cashier's check and the process is very easy, the fee for the cashier check has been waived off by the teller. Very friendly.Same story ..months later..one hour for only 6 people... people talking and going bothering the 1 teller to do other things. Hispanic Manager lady noting ""not her fault"" she finds security guard and decides to CLOSE the teller line..instead of helping to get it cleared and get customers served.  Oh and after the security guard was in charge of not letting any more customers in line she and another office lady took their Uber lunch and went to the back to eat. After being a customer for over 30 years I will be moving my account. First closed the drive thru then locations then Saturdays and finally cutting hours to make it the most inconvenient for customer to bank..but this location is the worst branch I have experienced in my 40 years of banking. I hope my next bank choice has customer appreciation and service. Extremely unfortunate... customers beware.Attitude of the woman teller is the worst. Impolite, rude and thinks of herself too much. The manager short guy with glasses does not even know what he is doing there. Dream teamHorrible customer service
I needed to change my pen number. The lady skip me in line and seems like she did not want to help me until the other customer told  her to help me first. After that she refused to help me and give me some exuces so I just left and went to the other one on Felipe street.I have been with this bank for 8 years, today I came to deposit a check, they couldn't read one letter of my last name correctly. They refused to accept my check.  I went to another bankofAmerica and they accepted it without question!  They answer the same to all 1 star  reviews !!!!very bad service after eight years I will close my accountThis is the worst location you can go to. Unorganized, the staff just walking around while customers be waiting, it takes them an hour just to pass 2 people. What’s a nightmare. The problem is the manager (a Spanish lady) has no sense of getting her workers together. A change of management would fix the problem. I could give it 0 starts but that’s not an optionDefinitely the worst location I have been to. Staff have horrible attitudes, ATMs outside are always broken and there is always a long line due to short staff. Better to go with Chase bank‼️Everytime I come here to make a deposit there is always a long line and ONLY 1 person always working the window. Super slow here. If your in a hurry go to San Felipe.The worst branch ever. They are always understaffed the customer rep is rude. No respect for business customers. Save yourself time and money and go else where.Worst location ever. The workers there seem to do not care at all.
You have 3 people helping 1 costumer meanwhile there’s like 5 others waiting for the longest. Also the lady behind the counter was like super sick coughing everywhere. Avoid this location.The worst location I have ever seen , only one cashier working while others were busy gisting. On line for almost 1hrThis branch of Bank of America for some reason always have some kind of issues with their computers and turn their customers away to other locations. They need to resolve their problems once and for all. Very frustrating and annoying.Long waiting time and only one teller in the cash counter we call manager they also refused to help people so many staff in this branch but only watching us they don’t come to even ask to help very worst situation almost hour I was in the line.This place is a joke. Even with the appointment you’ll have to wait for 30 mins and nobody cares about customer. You have to go and keep checking if someone becomes available to help you.So slow location maybe manager could manage that. There are more than 10 people on the line and only 1 counter is working it’s so slow that could be fastLong waiting and they gave me time but I waited more than hour and nobody cares…
Bad customer service all bad!!!!Very bad customer serviceReScheduling me from last week for today and saying I have to have an appointment then showing up for my appointment waiting for 30 minutes then saying I have to wait for another 30 minutes

That’s not cool at allhorrible.

waited in line for 30 mins on teller.

short staffed and mismanaged.Worst branch ever, there is always such a long wait with only one teller. So annoying. PLEASE EMPLOY workersThe line was so long and there was one teller only and many people on the line waiting meanwhile there was BOA employees standing there talking and laughing, this is a very bad BOA location and rude inappropriate associates.It's always annoying and crowdedWow!

Excellent service from management to customer service. The person who helped me, Katherine Bonilla, was wonderful. Very special when dealing with the client, he explains everything very well and is very patient. I admire his professionalism, always with a smile. It is a pleasure. I am happy to have completed my procedures and not to have made a mistake in selecting Bank of America.Katherine and Sonia are very friendly, always with a very good attitude. I don't know how to use my digital much but they are always available. I hope they have many more people like them.Well, the service for me has been phenomenal with everyone, especially the manager Angelina, who treated me extremely well with all the questions I asked her and was very patient with me. I recommend you go there to solve your doubtsIf I could give this place zero stars I would but sadly I have to do it so I can tell you about my experience. I do not recommend this bank at all, a while ago I went and was attended by a man with a Venezuelan accent who clearly had no desire to work, very unprofessional, and he was also not well informed of due process, if you are one of the people who appreciates your time go elsewhere. Very disappointed 🥲I had to come to the bank twice in a row to verify my identity due to bad work by the staff. I am really disappointed with bank of americaI feel very satisfied with the treatment and the good attention from Katherine and Angelina, they were very kind and professional in their work.Katherine was very helpful delighted to open account with Bank Of AmericaKatherine was excellent.

561,Bank of America,"3704 Old Spanish Trl, Houston, TX 77021",Houston,"Visited this location just because it does happen to be closer to me, I needed a document notarized. I began to get concerned because Nereyda Gonzalez misread the document initially I had to correct her, it seemed she understood the correction, but said she would have to ask her manager which took several minutes I didn’t mind that, however She came back saying she couldn’t notarize the document. I pointed out that this doc was not listed on the Bank of America site. Asked to get the name of the manager she walked away again, a few minutes later Diana Tovar came over. Their uncertainty gave me pause so I decided to go to another Bank of America location it’s a little further away, but there I had no issue. They were familiar, knowledgeable, & kind. Big difference between these 2 locations. My family will continue to just make a further drive, it’s worth it.The worst experience at this facility.
Today my husband and I stopped by to make a withdrawal from our accounts.
We were told it couldn't happen without the signature of their supervisor.
The supervisor was in a meeting, we waited 20 min for the signature, that never happened.

It so happened the supervisor was in a meetingI know banks can be a pain, but this location is always quick and very helpful. Never had an issue at this one and they always have multiple tellers. Thank you to Alyssa today! Went the extra mile and I really appreciate the gesture. Everyone always very kind.Horrible banking experience! I have been banking with Chase for decades and never had issues with them. I decided to open a second bank account and went with Bank of America and it has been a nightmare! I did a 1st deposit if a check from my job and no issues however,  I did the second deposit a week later from the same place of employment and bank of America has a hold on it for a week! I called customer service and got nowhere! I will wait for my funds to clear and close out immediately! Do yourself a HUGE favor for your sanity and stay away from Bank Of America.  Trust me , it will benefit you.Received a letter in the mail with a bonus promotion for opening a checking account with direct deposit. Opened an account online which was approved. Funded the account, set up online banking and set up direct deposit with my employer. Then the next day the online banking stated my account was locked. Called BOA waited 20+ minutes on hold. They said my account couldn’t be verified and had to go in person to a bank.

What frustrated me was having the account approved and setting up everything, but they couldn’t verify my information. The account shouldn’t have been approved in the first place.

I go to BOA with driver’s license and SSN to verify myself. They have a line outside the door. Waited 30+ minutes to speak with a banker.

The banker said the system already closed the account and I have to open a new account. Ok that’s fine, but what about the promotion. I already shredded the promo code. She’s on the phone for 20+ minutes with a department. They tell her to call another department to get the promotion code, but they’re already closed because it’s passed 4pm.

They wanted me to go in tomorrow to redo all this mess. I asked if we can do this over the phone or email and make a copy of my DL and SSN, but nope they said I had to be in person. I just took my funds out of the account

My first and last experience with Bank of AmericaI've called the location numerous times and they refuse to answer. Why have a phone?Excellent serviceGreatI have been with BOA for many years, I have not had bad experiences, they have helped me in everything I needed.
What they lack is more kindness, having a smiling face is the key for the customer to leave satisfied; I have experience in customer service and I know what I'm talking about. Smile smile 😁😁😁Excellent attention. And beautiful administrative staffBefore leaving count your money 💰 😉 …","Positives:

562,Bank of America,"5801 East Sam Houston Pkwy N, Houston, TX 77049",Houston,"I had the worst experience at this branch. They deposited my money to someone else’s account. I checked my BOA App later on and still didn’t see the transaction shown in my account. I had to make an additional trip back to that branch and let them correct the mistake. Unfortunately, they still messed up my money order that I deposited during the same transaction. They bounced the money order I received from my tenant. I called the fraud department and questioned how in the world the money order can be bounced? the first guy said it was possible. But he told me there was nothing he can do at the moment. I had to make another phone call and told the guy I was with my tenant when he bought the money order. And I have never had any problem to deposit his money order to my WF bank account. Why this time I deposit his money order to BOA account and BIA bounced his check?? Finally the guy created a case number and problem solved after 30 days. BOA, your service SUCKS!!This place is the absolute worst place to do any financial business. The employees are lazy disrespectful and downright rude. Their hours constantly change and are very self serving to only the employees of this branch. They could be standing there doing nothing but yet you still have to have an appointment. They have gotten so ridiculous with their Covid protocol that they don’t help and refuse to help anyone.
I have been to this location for damn near 20 years. I started my account well over 30 years ago in San Antonio. I have been a loyal customer and I have never seen such disrespect for the public. The only thing convenient about this branch is its location. What a waste.I made an appointment  with a Home Loan agent, and they couldn't find my appointment. Also, the agent wasn't at the office at that time.This is the best bank I’ve been too. My card info was stolen and I went to a different bank for help and they were 1. Super rude 2. Did not help and 3. Said that they wanted nothing to do with it and that I had to call. When I went to this bank I was honestly loosing hope because I’ve been going through so much and no bank was helping. However this bank solved my problem right away and they were super kind and told me exactly what to do and guided me through it. And a special thank you to Shady for being so helpful!I lost my credit card because the employees at this branch don't know what they are doing or how their own system works. Shady Abdallah, failed to add my document to my account properly and it was never received by the bank. And the delay caused my this mistake cause my credit card to be closed.Rodolfo Saavedra is one of the nicest bankers I've had the pleasure of dealing with in a long time he was patient with my situation and helped me without any judgment
Thank you so much I will bank at this location any day of the weekI DIDNT KNOW BANK OF AMERICA WILL BE WORST THAN WHAT I ALREADY BEEN THROUGH

I CAME TO CASH A CHEFK AND THE MANAGER SAID ITS A FAKE CHECK AND BASED ON THAT IM FILING A LAW SUIT AGAINST HIM

564,Bank of America,"1127 Edgebrook Dr, Houston, TX 77034",Houston,"10am to 4pm. Seriously?  What is this France?  So we have to take off work to fit stopping at the bank bc you can't hire enough people to run a bank on normal hours?Friday 1pm one teller behind the counter. Also I filled out a deposit slip to deposit paycheck and teller deposits into the wrong account luckily I caught it. What a jokeAmazing service from Jeremy Flemings at the 7770 Highway 6N location!

I needed a signature guarantee (NOT a medallion signature guarantee) on a form in order to open an account with the US Treasury. I knew for a fact from the Bank of America website that this service is provided to customers (customers of at least 6 months).

I went to 2 different locations (before coming to this one) and were automatically told: ""We don't provide that service here."" Once, I was even told that before the employee even looked at my form.

Jeremy at the 7770 HWY6N location took a look at my form and immediately recognized it. He said he started seeing the forms more frequently about a month ago and had to look into Bank of America procedures to confirm if this was a service offered by the bank.

Jeremy had great customer service and I appreciated him for simply making the effort to confirm before automatically answering no.Decided to drop by this location to take care of our banking needs.. big mistake. Even with 1 teller working on a Friday, with 3 people in front of me, figured it wouldn't take long to make a deposit. After standing in line for 20 minutes, a banking representative moved 4 people who were previously not in line, ahead of us. After 25 minutes, the line behind me grew to 12 people, without any forward progress or support from the branch management. Needless to say, after years of poor customer service, this was the last straw and we have stopped all banking with BofA.The service is ok just like the rest of the other locations, BUT in this location they are definitely the laziest of the branches in my area. EVERY brach opens at 9:00 am in my area, but this one opens at 10:00 am! Why is there not a universal schedule? We need to get going in the morning and unfortunately this branch is the closest to my house, such an inconvenience to have to drive to another branch because this one is to lazy to open one hour earlier like the rest of them!!!This by far is not only the worse branch I have ever did business with but the worse bank. The customer service is horrible at this location . They show favoritism towards Spanish speaking customers and the tellers act like they hate their job. One time I went here and the teller raised her voice at me and rolled her eyes all because I asked her to better explain a policy . When all other banks are bringing back their regular lobby hours they still have there hours set to 4PM during the work. Which is horrible for most people

The atms always give me some type of error message and I have to redo the entire process.

The staff is not diverse at all which would be nice since their customer service is based on if the customer is the same race

When you call for customer service you have to hold for more than 30 min and food luck trying to quickly call them from the app

Bank with a better bank. Especially if you are a none Spanish speaker . I banked here for convenience but I will go back to Chase or my local credit union and to Bank of America do some customer service sensitivity and diversity trainingHorrible I’m new to this bank and they never pick up the phone. I got my card and it never let me put a pin for the card. They said they would “mail me my pin for security purposes” but I’ve never received it at allYou need to hire additional tellers please or else people will take their business elsewhere.Waited in line for over 30 minutes. It was not until the line was out the door before they got someone else behind the front counter to assist. Once help came they processed my cashiers check fast.The worst branch of bank of america I ever visit with bad customer service,I spent  there a hour waiting for someone helping me and I ordered  check  and they told me that I will receive it by May24,today is May 28 ,I don't recieve it yet. They deserve  zero starWe have an account as commercial not only is there not a seperate spot for businesses but there is only 1 bank teller! Im running my deposit on company time i shouldnt have to wait an hour and it affect my business because they are short staffer very unprofessional!Can’t cash a cashiers check, why print them? Pointless service. They should make a note of this before you waste an hour in their line with 1 tellerWorst bank ever had me waiting in line 40 minutes just to tell me they cant cash my check because of the amount most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heardJeremy helped me with a great attitude and knowledge.

Not a good way to run a business no wonder they have 2 starsThey could not have hired slower people to work here. No star isn’t an option.Bad costumers serviceThree lanes. No waiting.not to crowdedBad customer treatment. I went to claim my money. And the least they do is pay attention to you. The customer is worth nothing to them. If you have claims to make. NEVER GO TO THIS BANK. once again I come back and nothing changes. what's wrong with them? Here nothing matters to them when it comes to the customer. He himself who leaves you the money so that you can become rich. I will close my accounts with you.Very bad attention, I made a request for a red credit card, they told me that I would arrive in 15 and I didn't, they called me by phone to find out if I had received it, I answered no and they told me that they were going to call me again to tell me the reason and they never did I had to go personally and they gave them a card with a number so that I can lose it again whose final number to communicate to youThey never answerExcellent atention","Positives:

565,Bank of America,"5171 San Felipe St, Houston, TX 77056",Houston,"Great experience! Very nice and friendly environmentStaff is good at this location but a joke that it doesn’t open until 10am.  Also the Bank of America close to the Boy Scouts is closed permanently yet that won’t stop google from directing you there.  Or possibly you could go to the one on Yale that doesn’t have a live person.  You can do a “teleconference”.  Hopefully they are paying 8% on their CDs since they are saving so much $$ by skimping on their services.Cuong Nguyen is exceptionally welcoming and patient. He went out of his way to assist me, patiently addressing all my questions and concerns.Terrible experience with Annette Brown.  Very rude, not helpful and very disrespectful.

566,Bank of America,"8773 Katy Fwy, Houston, TX 77024",Houston,"I truly appreciate their on-time assistance in all the processes to finally come up with a checking account as this is my first bank as a newbie in 🇺🇸. It was fast and efficient transaction with an accommodating staffs. Thank you so much! 😊🌎 …I went in today to notarize a letter; I was attended by Maria Jay. She was great help. I usually go to different branch closer but they did not have appointments. I am very glad I came to this location instead. I would definitely come back to this location. Customer service is great.This bank has been ran so awfully  for the past decade, the ATM's are broken half the time only reason i use them was the proximity but believe me you do not want to do business with them. 1 employee on lobby for rush hour, and finally my day has come and that's why I figured I'd leave this review. The ATM took my funds and did not reflect on the account. Obviously someone isn't doing their job correctly at this branch. I believe if I deposit it on the atm TODAY I want to use it TODAY . If YOUR machine breaks it is up to YOU to reimburse me IMMEDIATELY via cash or via system.  Called the number on the ATM and then spoke to someone for 1 hour then transferred to another department for ""dispute"" of my OWN money. 24 hours for it to be ""investigated"" so ridiculous stay clear of them.Very Racist Branch! They racial profile and the teller treated me as if I was stealing my own money. They wouldn’t let me cash my check even though when they checked to deposit it they made more than half of the check available. The teller purposely put an extended hold on my money and now I can’t get access until 7 days for the full amount. I wish I went to my branch instead of this horrible one. I hate going to a bank and being made to feel like a criminal about my money.This bank has great and professional services and staff.  Geovanny was very helpful with my business needs. #greatbranch #smallbusinessbankingIf I could give this location negative stars I would. I worked for Bank of America for 9 years, and have been a customer there for over 20 years. I went in today to have my signature notarized on some of my work documents. I showed 2 forms of ID, and sat for 30 minutes while Maria Jay was typing on the computer, looking through screens trying to figure out what she was doing. She finally asked me, what the documents were. Instead of me telling her it was none of her business (as I should have done) because she only needed to notarize my signature, I informed her what they pertained to. She then went on to ask if my global company had an account with Bank of America to which I responded, “I don’t know, but I have an account with you and it’s my signature you’re notarizing, not my company’s. She then went to a manager, and came back and told me that she was unable to notarize my signature because she would need to see proof that I was an employee. I offered to go to my car to get my work badge to provide her proof. She then said (along with what I could only assume was an assistant manager or manager who came over not to help, but to rush things along so she could complete dual-control on something) that I would need to provide the last 4 digits of the account number for my global company that I am a signer on because the document was pertaining to my company. I explained to them that I work in contracts for my company, and I’m not part of finance so I’m not a signer on any of their accounts. They told me they could not notarize my signature. Bank of America!  I urge you to please train your associates!  The main purpose of a notary is to certify that the person signing the document is who they claim to be when they sign that document; hence the 2 forms of ID!!  Please teach Maria that she doesn’t need to know what the document is!  All she needs to be concerned with is if she can receive proper identification to CERTIFY AND NOTARIZE that the person in front of her that is signing that document is who they say they are!  Bank of America (namely Maria Jay) should be embarrassed!  She has no idea how to be a notary, and she’s going to upset a lot of people if she continues her ignorance.Good experience overall. There was a man standing near the entrance who asked me what I was there for and if I needed help, which I appreciated. I only had to wait a few minutes with 4 people in line and 2 tellers at the desk. Mona was very professional and helpful while the other teller with her hair in a bun seemed very friendly as well.

I was worried about past reviews regarding the tellers but if I see Mona or the other lady again I would not be concerned.Geo did an amazing job helping me and was in and out in no time.I walked in to this branch, there was only one teller at the window and me the only customer at the time. I walked up said hello, this person had her head down the entire time. I spoke again, she said nothing! (I should have left but I needed cash)  Still saying nothing, head down still looking bitter and unhappy in the face. I then placed my check in the drawer.It took her about 30 seconds to grab my check. (No smiles, dry AF) she grabbed my check, I said I’d like to cash this check, still nothing. Head still down. She couldn’t figure out what she was doing so she called a manager over. (Hispanic man) as he walked up he asked how my day was and said hello.  He did what he did and it went through. She then asked how I would like my money. That was complete. She said here you go. I said thank you and she said nothing. I took my envelope said thanks and left. As I was leaving I heard her greeting the customer who walked in behind me. Hello sir, how are you in a chipper voice. I’m like wow to myself. They both were white.
The teller was short, white female, heavy set, very short pink tip nails, with blonde hair a little past her shoulder. I wish I knew her name, I’d call you out! I won’t be back to this location, she was drawn to her own kind.Worst customer service. Unfortunately, I have it a block away from my warehouse and I am  forced to use them for my business needs when rush. You never receive an smile. Always 3 - 4 cashiers but only one always available. Others just stand behind talking. I do all to avoid this branch.Came to this location on a Saturday.  There were only 2 tellers open in the lobby, one for the business clients and the other for the regular banking which that one had 15 customers waiting...im pretty sure they know that Saturdays is one of their busy days. Smh!This was the best Bank of America I have been to so far. Staff were very kind, professional, and eager to help.I’m RJ and I’m thankful of the service from Geo.Lucie was very helpful! My husband and I went in to set up a joint account and didn't think to make an appointment. Despite it being fairly busy, she helped us by sending an online application and checked in on us frequently to be sure we figured it out.Customer Service from Cameron and Geo was excellent.ATM machine is fine (one time wasn't good in weekend)Worst customer service every time disappointed they never have change for business customersThe team at this location is very friendly and professional. I enjoy going to this location for help.The worst branch. Not enough tellars and they are very slowFor some reason the people employed here don't know how to answer the phones.Never go there
Rud peopleI have had the distinct pleasure of working with this branch after years of being with Bank of America as a business customer. Now, I have opened both an estate account and a credit card account with them and the gentlemen I worked with at the Willowbrook could not have been more helpful in beginning the process of streamlining my deceased  grandmother's multiple accounts into one concise estate account.It was easy to carry out my banking procedures, thanks to the collaboration and kindness of Geo, his entry manager Jesus was able to quickly direct me to someone who could solve my problems, thank you very much guys!!!Excellent service, I received a lot of help from the advisor Geovanny speaks Spanish and is very friendly.

569,Bank of America,"7455 Farm to Market 1960 Rd W, Houston, TX 77070",Houston,"It's unfortunate that I have to write this review on Bank of America. We made an appointment with a loan specialist her name is Erica Rodriguez. Unfortunately she was having a bad day she was very negative about all the questions that we asked about a HELOC. She didn't even give us an opportunity to try to apply for the loan. Needless to say we will not be using this branch any longer.Some corporate rules I dislike but this BofA location staff knows me by sight and helps me with any and all problems.  I've had a check stollen and credit card fraud.  The staff guided me with professionalism.  My GO TO group with my money.Walked in with a payroll check issued from Bank of America. Because I do not have an account with them, they charged me an $8.00 fee to cash a $50.00 check. Since when has this become legal? I would never do business with an institution who short stops my employee from obtaining his/her pay. Terrible business practice.They also discriminate as well .The good must be recognized and together with my wife we felt very well cared for by the advisor Ana López, she gave us all the information we needed, congratulations for your good service","Positives:

570,Bank of America,"7696 Katy Fwy, Houston, TX 77024",Houston,"Despite having a scheduled appointment to open an account, I felt like the roles were reversed during my visit. Instead of being treated as a valued client, I was made to feel like an inconvenience. The lady who assisted me seemed disinterested, provided conflicting information, and created an unwelcoming atmosphere. This encounter has left me questioning my choice of this bank. It's disheartening to feel like the service provider is doing me a favor rather than the other way around. I am now seriously reconsidering my banking options.As someone who works in customer service I must say that the experience in this location was absolutely horrible. What the manager communicated didn’t make any sense and was contradictory from what was communicated to me by Bank of America customer service via phone. When I asked for her to provide any kind of documentation or somewhere I could go online to verify the validity of the information she communicated, she was unwilling to do so and was rather condescending. As an area manager for a major corporation, she is not the type of person I would want leading any of my locations based off my experience with her at this location today. Do better Bank of America!Mss. Sandra Hadley and Tiffany Preston were fantastic in helping my banking needs be met. Awesome customer service.I work at a local business and have entered this location on numerous occasions. The Tellers have always been exceptionally friendly, and provided me with efficient service. I can contest that depending on the time of day that you go to make a deposit there can tend to be a rather lengthy line. However it always seems to run fairly quickly, were my wait time has always been 10 minutes or less.They give wrong information. I can’t wait to handle the situation I’m dealing with to cancel all my Bank of America accounts.Worse. Customer service from the gentleman in the front door today 11/16/22 at 12:45pm. Myself as a manager would never want anyone of my team to talk to a customer like if they weren’t valued customer. I was just simply trying to open an account for my mother and the African American guy literally started to raised his voice at us in-front of other clients like sir please talk to me with your low voice I’m in front of you other people don’t need to know our business. Please talk to your member tell him if he can’t properly greet customer or talk to them directly with professionals  he should be behind the window.If I could give negative stars, this location would get the maximum amount. Bank of America should be ashamed of the way the employees act here. The lines are long and every customer seemed to catch attitude from both tellers. I don't understand why people work at places when they hate everything about it. CLEAN HOUSE. Avoid this location!!Worst bank ever. 1 cashier but 2 other employees standing in the lobby asking if they “can help you”. Once you tell them, they say that they’ll be with you…..and then walk away. Terrible customer service. We WILL be closing our account after this ridiculous experienceOnly one teller, 18 people in line, waiting to be attended. 56 minutes wasted only to cash a check.One person working 15 people in line.  Managers just walking around no one trying to help the one clerk at the counter.  Ridiculous!!!!my wife went yesterday and the treatment was terrible. I do not recommend this placeBoth arms down.","Positives:
- Sandra Hadley and Tiffany Preston provided excellent customer service
- The tellers have always been friendly and efficient

- There should be better communication and coordination between employees and customer service representatives
- The bank should ensure that employees are knowledgeable and provide accurate information
- The bank should hire more staff to reduce wait times and improve efficiency
- The bank should address issues of condescending behavior and unprofessionalism from employees

I bet the people after me ended up waiting longer since line getting much longer.Mr Muhammad is so rude.. i wanted to open a account. He just gave me a excuse saying they are busy. Very bad customer service.Been a customer here last 16 years never had a bad experience ..The bank manager allowed a gentleman to walk in and talk to her while two people were waiting in line. Then she tried to get me to leave the bank instead of waiting for a notary. Then she talked over me and wouldn't do anything other than call or email another branch. I was told that the person who held their medallion notary stamp was out of the bank. The rep called Sugarland, no answer. The manager claims that she emailed the Sugarland location, and didn't get a response. So the bank manager said drive over to Sugarland. Why wouldn't she make an appt for me at another location? Why wouldn't she call back until someone answered. Terrible, terrible customer service! Gas is not cheap. Time is valuable. I am a customer. Treat me with respect and provide me with polite customer service!This branch is the worst branch ever. They keep turning customers aways and you would experience a very long queue. Waited for over an hour just to get a transfer done.

Will keep coming back to this location. :)Nothing changes  horrible  longgggg line one teller in the lobby ! Was in line over 45 minutes... and dont be apologizing cause its been the same issue!This branch wouldn't cash a lottery check for their customers but will do so for a random person without an account. My hubby account is not negative but they said he has to have twice the amount of the lottery winnings to cash the check. What idiocy?BOA I have a very bad experience in the lobby. Drive thru not available. Only one taller working. Around 10-2 people waiting in the lineThe Manager, a very short guy is a complete a$$hole, disrepectfull. Wouldnt cash my check, even though i am a account holder and even the check was from a bank of america account holder.. reason: it was too big to be cashed out..Waited for almost a half an hour due to no tellers! I guess they don’t understand some people are not paid hourly. The staff here are rude and lazy!  Do not come to this branch right now unless you are retired!This bank customer service is horrible ,better to go other location,no one can help you proper don’t waste your timeTerrible! Long line and only one teller!

Some times only one teller but usually is fastNo line, fast, and friendly service throughout. Teller Cristina was most pleasant to work with and answered any questions I had.I had a terrible experience at this bank. I'm not going into detail. They need a new manager!1. Banks poorly trained. Don't know their own bank policy and require clients to go back multiple times for something that could be done on one visit;
2. Horrible wait times. 45 minutes to deposit one check?!I've had this bank for over 30 years, but this location sucks so bad I'm considering changing just so I never have to use it again. This place is the definition of rude and worthless. They make Walmart feel like you're at a friendly church gathering. Don't go (well, try not to go here EVER) if you're in a hurry, because you're virtually guaranteed to have one teller. If there's actually a second one, it's a certainty she'll close the window when it's your turn and there's a line. And then a worthless manager will walk by and shrug her shoulders and say that's all she has available right now. God forbid the manager try to help. Despite the hassles of changing banks, it will be worth it to avoid this pitiful location.

ETA: decided to try and go back 9 months later to get a simple cashier's check. Saturday morning, one teller, one huge line. There were a couple of loan officers sitting idly at their desks, rude as usual and unwilling to help. I'm really glad you guys shared this with your leadership team. It's making a big difference.... NOT. This place is as pitiful as ever.Jocelyn Padilla is the best! 5 stars for the amazing help and support given! I highly recommend this locationI made an appointment for notary services.

Something is not right with bank of america... they really need to gain trust of thier customers.... digusted by bank of america, even when its open, theres is no tellers no cashiers .... there is something wrong with people who work at bank of america....Not a full service location anymore. Only ATM. Not good news for business accounts deposits with multiple checks, and cash. BOA needs to change this.OkExcellent service and kindness, they helped me with whatever I needed, thank you for your services.The worst attention that one can receive here, I am here waiting to open an account, the one at the door prefers to be talking and the one who should attend to me. And I have to open an account because the company asks for it, otherwise I wouldn't do it.Very clean and good service, but needs more telersBe careful, those who work there have contact with criminals and when you take out money they notify you and steal everything they took out.","Positives:
- Excellent service and kindness
- Very clean and good service
- Good bank

Room for Improvement:
- Not enough tellers
- Drive-thru is frequently closed
- Long wait times
- Not a full-service location
- Need more tellers

574,Bank of America,"11739 W Bellfort Blvd, Stafford, TX 77477",Houston,"Worst customer service ever! No courtesy or understanding and their bankers always take people out of line when everyone is waiting for their turn in line. Absolutely the last branch I would visit unless I didn't have a choice and they were the only branch left in the entire city!I was at branch a bit before my appointment time, but when my time arrived the banker taken other one (her special friends) and kept me waiting!!!
Looks there are no manager here at this branch, most worse branch everI had a bad experience lately, a guy at the front office of the bank of this exact location, when I asked him several questions his tone of voice sounded as if he was annoyed at being asked questions from customers, his stare conveyed annoyingness. He vaguely gave me some information. My brother too asked him some questions but he treated my brother just as I was treated. I consider this as lack of professionalism from him. Unfortunately I don't know his name since he didn't introduce himself, but he is hispanic/latino , has glasses, is skinny and is new to this location since I have come to this location for years and never seen him which leads me to believe he is new.  | To be honest I have come to this location for years and everyone is professional and has treated me extremely well but this guy is the exception. I ask myself, if he is indeed annoyed at his job, why not quit and let other new employee replace him? Can't he find a job that he truly likes? I have decided to go to another location instead. I have 3 friends of mine who have also come here to this location and they have also experienced the same unprofessional treatment from that guy in particular. Does Bank of America even organizes meetings with employees to remind them to treat clients with respect and remain cordial at all times? I wouldn't be surprised if the bank doesn't even do that at least. Extremely disappointed.We had a appointment at 9:00 AM but we waited 16 minutes till 9:16 AM outside the door the employees were in inside walking but not opening the door for customers it supposed to open at 9:00 it was very horrible experience they need to improve more their customers serviceIt’s ridiculous that they only have 1 teller specially during peak hours. Waited over 40 min to deposit 1 checkAbsolute unless branch. Never have enough cashiers. The security guard just makes up the lines as he wishes and put anyone in line he pleases.

Update 4/26/2023: still slow, still only one cashier, more employees than customers but the urgency to help seems to be missing.You need for ever to get served here, the tellers are too slow and only 2 employees working in this busy branch, I had to wait 45min to deposit and withdrawI used to do my business at this establishment but since they changed manager is just waste of time visiting this location.
Can’t even get helped to open a account1 teller atleast 14 people in line. How many workers standing in the front with their ipads mingling about the world cup atleast 3-4…did they help nah. Heres the kicker after waiting 35 mins its my turn lady at the Teller says sir you can only withdraw X amount of money from my OWN CHECKING ACCOUNT?!? I am sure as hell confused my money and your telling me i have a limit because of the holidays lame excuse heres an idea how about yall order my money instead of telling me to go to another branch after waiting 35 mins. Dont bank with bank of america go somewhere else that has a drive thru and cares about customersTheir ATMs are always out of order. Third class service. Never bank with this Bank.Waited in line for 40 minutes, there was a gentleman infront of us that had been waiting probally more than an hour and decided to go to the “business acct” side since there was no one in that line to be helped, & the RUDEST LADY EVER that was working there told him to “READ” the sign, that she couldnt help him bc he did not have a business acct!? Then proceeded to call us forward and help us bt we did not have a business acct at all! LOL why can’t you just be nice, have some sympathy for the customers waiting to be helped instead of looking down on them just because they where not in the correct line. All he wanted was help, & all he got was a nasty rude woman that had zero intention of helping him, maybe thats why the line was soo slow because this lady had zero intention of helping anyone out. What a joke, do not come here.Very helpful young lady helped us open an account, however I didn't leave this branch happy. I'll explain.
They required two forms of ID, and refused to accept DV1 visa page on the passport as an ID. She had to run it by manager who agreed with her. Now, I may not know the regulations set in place by BOFA to open an account, but I sure know, DV1 page is valid photo ID when it comes to this - Had my and other acquaintances' bank accounts opened this way; That's right, in
another Bank of America location. I asked to speak to the manager myself who explained this is the case with ONLY F1 visas. I was confused, this doesn't make sense. After the documents were passed back and forth between the employees, they handed it back to us. The manager then came by shortly and said, and I quote: ""We can make an exception just this time"" and asked to take the documents again.

To whom it may concern,

I am fairly new BOFA customer; less than 3 years. So I don't actually mind separating my ways with unproffesional bankers, but what justifies rejecting new customers?

Can you confirm above statement is what BOFA regulations require? If yes, how come this manager is capable of making exceptions? Or if the answer is No, why was I proven wrong, and after he did his homework, he still claimed I was wrong this was just an EXCEPTION?

I can provide names if this needs to be looked into, otherwise this will reflect on not only how you treat customers, also how you reject critisism.

Thank youZero service nobody’s taking care of anyone very poor management. I will never come here again if anyone’s coming here, just wasting there time and only one teller in counter .The bank was empty and still didn’t want to help me. Don’t go here!Fix your drive thru atms ! Not possible to deposit cash! This technology is from first generation atms . Even gas stations have better system! Fix Your ATM!Had to wait almost a hour to cash a check only one taller at the window on a Friday afternoon. I think they need to double think this the wait is horriableAlmost 20min in line and no one else was able to help..Horrible service at this location, they never answer the phones to answer simple questions, I have to make a trip all the way to the bank. Management are not professional. Don’t come to this bank at least not this location, just go to chase.In the teller line for over 25 minutes.  One teller attending to a line with about 12 people in line.Because of the manager over here I regret why I have business account in this bank that's how they treat thier clientsWorst Bank of America ever!! I can never be in and out and the workers barely want to work. This is the only location that I have issues with.Typical rude bank tellersVery bad experience,  Jonathan who's the manager assistant is very impolite, he's very rude,  inpatient not recommended this placeJacky is the best she loves her job and takes care of u step by step.best service everThe ATM is working fine but it is Monday and the doors are closed.Very good place, always super fast, the best possible service, many thanks to Mariana who always finds a space for her clients 😉Excellent service, very attentive staff and I recommend Jaqueline because she is a very easy-going person, polite and helps you solve any problem if it is within her reach, she does everything possible so that you leave satisfied, thank you for your attentionI don't understand why if they are closed they don't change hours on Google it says open and when you get to the bank it turns out that it is closed. how annoyingAll the banks in America are rubbish!Very good 👌 …","Positives:

575,Bank of America,"3223 W Lake Houston Pkwy, Humble, TX 77339",Houston,"Came in to make a withdrawal of $2,000 for a business expense. Brought 2 forms of ID and my bank of america card. Refused to allow me to make my withdrawal because I “didn’t have an ID on file” when their system has all my info that matches my 2 forms of photo ID. Their lobby is also notoriously understaffed and any minor service will take over an hour.

If you are looking for options for a business account, choose literally anybody other than bank of America.Ive called over and over and over sometimes even waited 15 minutes hoping someone would answer but this location refuses to acknowledge that their phone is ringing.ATM ate my card and manager did nothing but stand there and look stupid.Lady at front omg!! Worst customer service, If you don't like  what you do find something else. Never coming back to this locationThis place is awful, always one teller and long wait times. They need to do better.Again! Only one teller, 6 workers but only ONE teller. Time is money and BofA dont care about it.Another disappointment bank closed due to power outages.  Banks should have back up generators.Always one teller and a long line of customers.Awesome staffI just called multiple times (7x) and from different phone numbers, personal and company phones. No one answered but surely at 12:09 pm I called and was answered with no response and left on mute for 8 minutes till I hung up, I was able to listen to the conversation that a lady was handing to a gentlemen hes account number and routing number I also heard giggles by a gentleman and another lady. What a great customer service, THE WORST. I literally had to call customer service just to ask 1 question to be answered.

I literally had to call customer support just to ask 1 question to get an answer.","Positives:
- The staff at the bank branch is described as ""awesome.""
- The customer mentions having all their information on file, indicating that the bank has a good record-keeping system.

Room for Improvement:
- The bank branch is understaffed, resulting in long wait times and delays in service.
- The customer was refused a withdrawal despite having two forms of ID and their bank card, suggesting a lack of flexibility or understanding from the bank's side.
- The bank branch does not answer phone calls consistently, which can be frustrating for customers trying to reach them.

Miscellaneous:

576,Bank of America,"9710 Bissonnet St, Houston, TX 77036",Houston,"Absolutely do not understand BOA staffing. Two tellers (in a lobby access only BOA). With 4 individuals at the front of the store greeting asking how they can help. When you inform you’d like to withdraw cash they direct you to the back (as if you were not already headed in this direction).

Seems obvious if you are going to remove tellers for drive thru service and only allow lobby tellers. Maybe provide more than TWO tellers to provide service for the entire store.

Seems simple I know.

But sometimes people in management seem to not grasp simple concepts.

For reference, the photo is the line of people all attempting to be serviced by TWO tellers. Not pictured, the two other suits whom were greeting.This is not a bank, it's an anti bank. Do you belong to Bank of America and have any banking needs whatsoever? Well go somewhere else, because this location will 100 percent find a way to not make it happen.
First of all, you will wait in line forever. When it's finally your turn, a dour, angry, unhappy person will ask you what on earth you're doing there and how dare you bother them today, peasant.

Do you need 50 one dollar bills? Well too bad, we don't have any. Yes this has happened to me more than once. Do you need a cashier's check? Too bad, the machine is down. Oh you're back for it? Well too bad, the one employee who does that isn't here. Oh, the machine is up and the person is here? Well guess what buddy, we can't do it in one transaction with your debit card. Oh no, you've got to fill out separate forms and do separate transactions, and you've got to get back in that long line in between. Haha! Peasant!

I never come here without thinking about the goblins in Harry Potter. They will make you feel little and small and treat you with smug self satisfaction. It's not ""Can I please have your account number?"" It's,  ""Ma'am, you need an account to do that here!"" Well duh, here's my debit card. It's not ""Can I please see your ID?"" It's, ""Ma'am, you need a picture ID for that!"" Well duh, here it is.

Meanwhile the Chase across the street does what I want, efficiently and with a smile, always.

They need to clean the bats out of their belfry. I'd rather walk across hot coals at 4 in the morning in 3rd ward than step into this God forsaken placeTheir cards decline for no reason and service is beyond pathetic here. I’d recommend staying as far away from here as possible.Honestly, Jose Solis their financial solutions adviser was great!  His skills and customer service were above and beyond.  Now-a-days is very hard to find dedicated people like him. People that are patient and understanding with the needs of their customers. Bank of America needs more Associates like Jose and recognize them too.I recently opened a checking account at this branch. I had an excellent experience with Blanca Gonzalez. She answered all of my questions and was extremely helpful in the process.  Yes there are some wait times but that's to be expected with the government mandate of social distancing. If you go or need help ask for Blanca.Waited over 50 minutes for a notary. Was told multiple times it would be 10 more minutes. They only had one notary on staff…

@The person who will respond to this review: please incentivize your bankers to get a notary and send me an email to invoice you for wasting my time.It took forever when I went inside the lobby. I got there at 10 am as soon as it opened and one of the employees asked if another man could cut in front of me. It was rude and horrible.Always a line out the door. Only one teller.

Find a different BOA

Edit: They always ask if I want to open an account. Why would I do that when every BOA you enter requires you to wait hours.I wish I could give it 0 stars. They have the worst customer service ever. They made me wait 2 hours before telling me they couldn't help me! I have been with Bank of America for the past 12 years, but this location and its employees made me close my account and go to wells cargo!!!!!! AVOID it if you can!!There is no teller at this location, bank of america??? Is this a joke ? Or a bank? And there ever is anyone here, really a huge line of people coming outside the bank, and mind you, the drive through remains closed. This is not a bank its a joke..Make sure you go to Jaqueline Munguia! She explains everything really well and super nice! She taught me so many stuff I did not know about my account. You won’t regret going to herMost of the time there is only one teller behind the glass. The rest are just talking amoung each other. There are super slow.Lines are to long
Missing bankers to service peopleMultiples teller lines with only two tellers working.The worst branch forever 👎🏻👎🏻 …It is the intimate place that I recommend bad everythingI went to withdraw money from this bank and after I left there they followed me and assaulted me, no one else knew that I went to withdraw money, nothing more than the teller.

577,Bank of America,"7500 Fondren Rd, Houston, TX 77074",Houston,"People were very nice and helpful. You have to set up an appointment but they didn’t take long to see me.  They answered every question I had.Unreliable lobby opening hours. Went today. @ 10:22 AM and it was not open! BoA services getting lousy.These employees are the prime example of what Not to be...  I walk in to try and cash my check ISSUED BY Bank of America.  The teller at the window tells tells me I should call in advance 2 to give them enough time to have the money ready,  Rings his little bell and Here comes Patty.. The guy tells Patty the exact same thing that he just got done telling me and then Patty decides to tell me the exact same thing that I just heard 3 times within a matter of 2 minutes. Maybe Patty was having a bad day because her clothes were way too tight. somebody needs to show her where she should shop for her size.. She's obviously trying to prove something to herself. If she was all that genius she would know their is absolutely not one Bank of America from Pasadena to Houston to Galveston would answer their telephone. SO STOP LIEING GUYS.. Again just another location of where trash works the bigger banks saw right through them  And now they work for The Sorriest Company. Patty, You don't have to be nasty to your customers we already see it.Went to open the bank to open a account. I did everything online and they said all I needed was to show my id. I spoke with the Asian American banker lady and she said my account was denied because of risk management. I called and spoke with a representative and they said the banker closed my account because of fraud. Ma’am just because I am black doesn’t mean I wanted to do anything illegal. The fact that you had me sit on the couch instead of in your office shows you had one thing in mind as soon as I walked through the door. Shame on you!I went to withdrawal money in this location and they say I can’t because my phone number it’s not in there even though they took my phone number when we signed up the first time. They don’t know how to operate 👎 …Harold Rodriguez Was very helpfulThe teller, Ruben was very rude and unprofessional. After standing in line for
